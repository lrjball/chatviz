0,MORRIS, I love sheep. 
1,SHEPHERD #2, So do I. Terrific animals. Terrific. 
2,MORRIS, No trouble. 
3,SHEPHERD #2," No, no trouble. "
4,SHEPHERD #1," Except at shearing. They can play up a bit, then; 
        can't they? "
5,MORRIS," Oh, yeah, but I like that sort of little burst of 
        frenzy they have then, you know. I like it when they get a little bit 
        angry. Shows they're human. "
6,SHEPHERD #1," Oh, yeah. I-- I-- I'm not saying I dislike them 
        at shearing, you know, but they can be a bit of a handful; can't they?
        "
7,MORRIS," Well, so would you be if you had a great pair of 
        scissors snippin' away while someone held your back legs apart. "
8,SHEPHERD #1, Hm. 
9,MORRIS," You'd wiggle a bit. You'd kick up a bit of a fuss. 
        Heh. "
10,SHEPHERD #1," Yeah, I-- I'm not saying I just expect them to 
        stand around in the fields and nibble the grass and look a bit pretty. 
        I-- I'm not saying that. "
11,SHEPHERD #2," Oh, but they are pretty; aren't they? "
12,MORRIS, Yeah. 
13,SHEPHERD #1," Oh, yeah. "
14,SHEPHERD #2," I mean, look at that one over there against the 
        sky. The white of the coat, the little black face against the twinkling 
        stars beyond. "
15,MORRIS, Yes. Aww. Terrific. 
16,SHEPHERD #1, Mhm. 
17,MORRIS, Terrific animals. 
18,SHEPHERD #1, Mm. 
19,SHEPHERD #2, The little lambs in springtime. 
20,MORRIS, Oh. 
21,SHEPHERD #1, Ahh. 
22,MORRIS," The lambs, eh? Now you're talking. They're lovely, eh? 
        I love them. "
23,SHEPHERD #2," Oh, so do I, Morris. I love them more than 
        anything. Little white furry bundles. "
24,SHEPHERD #1, Mhmm. 
25,MORRIS," I think, of all God's creatures, sheep have the best 
        offspring. "
26,SHEPHERD #2," Oh, yes. Terrific animals. "
27,MORRIS, Mm. 
28,SHEPHERD #2, Terrific. 
29,SHEPHERD #1, Yeah. They're so sure-footed. 
30,SHEPHERD #2, Hm. 
31,MORRIS, And quick-witted. 
32,SHEPHERD #1, Are they quick-witted? 
33,MORRIS," Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're quite, uh, quick-witted.
        "
34,SHEPHERD #1, Mhm. 
35,SHEPHERD #2, Always cheerful. Hmm. 
36,SHEPHERD #1," Well, except at shearing. Hehhehheh. "
37,MORRIS, Why are you always on about shearing? 
38,SHEPHERD #1," I'm not always on about it, Morris. "
39,MORRIS," You are a great deflator, you are. "
40,SHEPHERD #1, He was-- 
41,MORRIS," Of all the moments in their little lives, you 
        unerringly put your finger on the one moment where they lose a little 
        bit of dignity. Well, I regard that as cheap, quite honestly. "
42,SHEPHERD #2," Oh, look! Look. One of them's looking up at us. 
        Heh. He knows we're talkin' about him. "
43,SHEPHERD #1," Morris, don't get me wrong. I actually like their 
        behavior at shearing. I actually like them when they get a little bit 
        cross. I find that endearing. "
44,MORRIS," That's the fantastic thing. They're beautiful to look 
        at, well-disposed, quite quick-witted, and yet, tough as nails. "
45,SHEPHERD #2, 
46,MORRIS, 
47,SHEPHERD #2," You know, I can't think of anything I'd rather do 
        than watch sheep. "
48,MORRIS, Mmm. 
49,SHEPHERD #1," The only other animals that I would be remotely 
        interested in watching would be cats. "
50,MORRIS, They don't have flocks of cats. 
51,SHEPHERD #1," No, I-- I'm not saying they do, Morris. "
52,MORRIS," Can you imagine a herds of cats waiting to be sheared? 
        Meow! Meow! Woo hoo hoo. "
53,SHEPHERD #2, Shh! Shh. I heard something over there. 
54,MORRIS, Wolves? 
55,SHEPHERD #2, Could be. 
56,MORRIS, Where? 
57,SHEPHERD #2, Over there. 
58,MORRIS, Right. 
59,SHEPHERD #4, Oowhh. 
60,SHEPHERD #2, That's not a wolf. 
61,SHEPHERD #4, S-- Gordon Bennett! 
62,SHEPHERD #3, 
63,MORRIS, I thought he was a wolf. 
64,SHEPHERD #3, You hit him right in the face! 
65,MORRIS," Well, he shouldn't come snooping 'round like that. "
66,SHEPHERD #3," You wait till you hear what we've just seen! The 
        most incredible things just happened! "
67,SHEPHERD #4, Don't tell 'em. Owhh. 
68,SHEPHERD #3," We were on the hillside over there when this 
        amazing- "
69,SHEPHERD #4, Don't tell them! They broke my bloody nose! 
70,SHEPHERD #3, Can't I tell them about the amazing th-- 
71,SHEPHERD #4, No! Oohh. 
72,SHEPHERD #3," Well, they said we were to tell everybody! "
73,SHEPHERD #4," Not people who break your bloody nose! Come on.
        "
74,SHEPHERD #1, Where are you going? 
75,SHEPHERD #3, Bethlehem. 
76,SHEPHERD #4, Nowhere! Good night. Uhh. 
77,MORRIS," That's right! Leave your sheep! Leave them to the 
        wolves! Call yourselves shepherds?! You're a disgrace to the profession!
        "
78,SHEPHERD #2," Huh. What a rotten thing to do,... "
79,MORRIS, Yeah. 
80,SHEPHERD #2," ...to go and leave those little helpless furry 
        bundles alone on the hillside. "
81,MORRIS, So they can go down to Bethlehem and get drunk. 
82,SHEPHERD #1, Is it A.D. yet? 
83,MORRIS, Quarter past. 
84,BABY BRIAN COHEN, 
85,WISE MAN #1, Ahem. 
86,MANDY COHEN, Ohhh! 
87,WISE MAN #1, We are three wise men. 
88,MANDY, What?! 
89,WISE MAN #1, We are three wise men. 
90,MANDY," Well, what are you doing creeping around a cow shed at 
        two o'clock in the morning? That doesn't sound very wise to me. "
91,WISE MAN #3, We are astrologers. 
92,WISE MAN #1, We have come from the East. 
93,MANDY, Is this some kind of joke? 
94,WISE MAN #2, We wish to praise the infant. 
95,WISE MAN #1, We must pay homage to him. 
96,MANDY," Homage? You're all drunk. It's disgusting. Out! The 
        lot, out! "
97,WISE MAN #1, No-- 
98,MANDY," Bursting in here with tales about oriental fortune 
        tellers. Come on. Out! "
99,WISE MAN #2," No, no. We must see him. "
100,MANDY, Go and praise someone else's brat! Go on! 
101,WISE MAN #2, We-- 
102,WISE MAN #1, We were led by a star. 
103,MANDY," Or led by a bottle, more like. Go on. Out! "
104,WISE MAN #1," Well-- well, we must see him. We have brought 
        presents. "
105,MANDY, Out! 
106,WISE MAN #2, Gold. Frankincense. Myrrh. 
107,MANDY," Well, why didn't you say? He's over there. Sorry the 
        place is a bit of a mess. Well, what is myrrh, anyway? "
108,WISE MAN #3, It is a valuable balm. 
109,MANDY," A balm? What are you giving him a balm for? It might 
        bite him. "
110,WISE MAN #3, What? 
111,MANDY," That's a dangerous animal. Quick! Throw it in the 
        trough. "
112,WISE MAN #1," No, it isn't. "
113,MANDY," Yes, it is. It's great, big mmm... "
114,WISE MAN #3," No, no, no. It is an ointment. "
115,MANDY," Aww, there is an animal called a balm,... or did I 
        dream it? So, you're astrologers, are you? Well, what is he then? "
116,WISE MAN #2, Hmm? 
117,MANDY, What star sign is he? 
118,WISE MAN #2," Uh, Capricorn. "
119,MANDY," Uhh, Capricorn, eh? What are they like? "
120,WISE MAN #2," Ooh, but... he is the son of God, our Messiah.
        "
121,WISE MAN #1, King of the Jews. 
122,MANDY," And that's Capricorn, is it? "
123,WISE MAN #2," Uh, no, no, no. That's just him. "
124,MANDY," Ohh, I was going to say, 'Otherwise, there'd be a lot 
        of them.' "
125,WISE MAN #1, By what name are you calling him? 
126,MANDY," Uh, 'Brian'. "
127,WISE MEN," We worship you, O Brian, who are Lord over us all. 
        Praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our Father. Amen. "
128,MANDY," Do you do a lot of this, then? "
129,WISE MAN #2, What? 
130,MANDY, This praising. 
131,WISE MAN #2," No, no. No, no. "
132,MANDY," Er, well, um, if you're dropping by again, do pop in. 
        Heh. And thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense, er, but don't worry 
        too much about the myrrh next time. All right? Heh. Thank you! Good-bye! 
        Well, weren't they nice? Hmm. Out of their bloody minds, but still. "
133,BABY BRIAN, 
134,MANDY, Shut up. 
135,Cartoon, 
136,SINGER," Brian. The babe they called 'Brian', He grew,... grew, 
        grew, and grew-- Grew up to be-- grew up to be A boy called 'Brian'-- A 
        boy called 'Brian'. He had arms... and legs... and hands... and feet, 
        This boy... whose name was 'Brian', And he grew,... grew, grew, and 
        grew-- Grew up to be-- Yes, he grew up to be A teenager called 'Brian'-- 
        A teenager called 'Brian', And his face became spotty. Yes, his face 
        became spotty, And his voice dropped down low And things started to grow 
        On young Brian and show He was certainly no-- No girl named 'Brian', Not 
        a girl named 'Brian'. And he started to shave And have one off the wrist 
        And want to see girls And go out and get pissed, A man called 'Brian'-- 
        This man called 'Brian'-- The man they called 'Brian'-- This man called 
        'Brian'! "
137,JESUS CHRIST," How blest are those who know their need of God. 
        How blest are the sorrowful. They shall find consolation. How blest are 
        those of gentle spirit. They shall have the earth for their possession. 
        How blest are those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail. "
138,RANDOM, 
139,JESUS," They shall be satisfied. How blest are those whose 
        hearts are pure. They shall see God... "
140,MANDY, Speak up! 
141,MAN, Shh. 
142,BRIAN," Quiet, Mum. "
143,JESUS, How blest are those of gentle... 
144,MANDY," Well, I can't hear a thing. "
145,JESUS," ...spirit. They shall have the earth for their 
        possession. "
146,MANDY, Let's go t' the stoning. 
147,JESUS, How blest are those... 
148,MR. BIG NOSE, Shh. 
149,JESUS, ...who hunger and thirst... 
150,BRIAN, You can go to a stoning any time. 
151,JESUS, ...to see right... 
152,MANDY," Oh, come on, Brian. "
153,JESUS, ...prevail. 
154,MR. BIG NOSE, Will you be quiet?! 
155,JESUS, How blest are they who have suffered much... 
156,MRS. BIG NOSE, Don't pick your nose. 
157,MR. BIG NOSE, I wasn't picking my nose. I was scratching. 
158,MRS. BIG NOSE," You was picking it, while you was talking to 
        that lady. "
159,MR. BIG NOSE, I wasn't! 
160,MRS. BIG NOSE, Leave it alone. Give it a rest. 
161,MR. CHEEKY, Do you mind? I can't hear a word he's saying. 
162,MRS. BIG NOSE," Don't you 'do you mind' me. I was talking to my 
        husband. "
163,MR. CHEEKY," Well, go and talk to him somewhere else. I can't 
        hear a bloody thing. "
164,MR. BIG NOSE, Don't you swear at my wife. 
165,MR. CHEEKY," I was only asking her to shut up, so I can hear 
        what he's saying, Big Nose. "
166,MRS. BIG NOSE, Don't you call my husband 'Big Nose'! 
167,MR. CHEEKY," Well, he has got a big nose. "
168,GREGORY," Could you be quiet, please? "
169,JESUS, They shall have the earth... 
170,GREGORY, What was that? 
171,JESUS, ...for their possession. How blest are those... 
172,MR. CHEEKY," I don't know. I was too busy talking to Big Nose.
        "
173,JESUS, ...who hunger and thirst to see... 
174,MAN #1, I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers.' 
175,JESUS, ...right prevail. 
176,MRS. GREGORY," Ahh, what's so special about the cheesemakers?
        "
177,GREGORY," Well, obviously, this is not meant to be taken 
        literally. It refers to any manufacturers of dairy products. "
178,MR. CHEEKY," See? If you hadn't been going on, we'd have heard 
        that, Big Nose. "
179,JESUS, How blest are those who... 
180,MR. BIG NOSE," Hey. Say that once more; I'll smash your bloody 
        face in. "
181,MRS. GREGORY, Ohh. 
182,MR. CHEEKY," Better keep listening. Might be a bit about 
        'Blessed are the big noses.' "
183,BRIAN," Oh, lay off him. "
184,MR. CHEEKY," Oh, you're not so bad yourself, Conkface. Where 
        are you two from? Nose City? "
185,MR. BIG NOSE," One more time, mate; I'll take you to the 
        fuckin' cleaners! "
186,MRS. BIG NOSE, Language! 
187,JESUS, ...hunger and thirst to see... 
188,MRS. BIG NOSE, And don't pick your nose. 
189,JESUS, ...right prevail. 
190,MR. BIG NOSE," I wasn't going to pick my nose. I was going to 
        thump him! "
191,MAN #2, You hear that? Blessed are the Greek. 
192,GREGORY, The Greek? 
193,MAN #2," Mmm. Well, apparently, he's going to inherit the 
        earth. "
194,GREGORY, Did anyone catch his name? 
195,MRS. BIG NOSE, You're not going to thump anybody. 
196,MR. BIG NOSE," I'll thump him if he calls me 'Big Nose' again.
        "
197,MR. CHEEKY," Oh, shut up, Big Nose. "
198,MR. BIG NOSE," Ah! All right. I warned you. I really will slug 
        you so hard-- "
199,MRS. BIG NOSE," Oh, it's the meek! Blessed are the meek! Oh, 
        that's nice, isn't it? I'm glad they're getting something, 'cause they 
        have a hell of a time. "
200,MR. CHEEKY," Listen. I'm only telling the truth. You have got a 
        very big nose. "
201,MR. BIG NOSE," Hey. Your nose is going to be three foot wide 
        across your face by the time I've finished with you! "
202,MAN #1 and MAN #2, Shhh. 
203,MR. CHEEKY," Well, who hit yours, then? Goliath's big brother?
        "
204,MR. BIG NOSE, Oh. Right. That's your last warning. 
205,MRS. GREGORY," Oh, do pipe down. "
206,GREGORY, Oh! 
207,MRS. GREGORY, Awa? 
208,MR. BIG NOSE, Silly bitch. Get in the way on me?... 
209,MRS. GREGORY, Ow!... 
210,MR. BIG NOSE, Break it up-- oh. Oh! 
211,MANDY," Oh, come on. Let's go to the stoning. "
212,BRIAN, All right. 
213,FRANCIS," Well, blessed is just about everyone with a vested 
        interest in the status quo, as far as I can tell, Reg. "
214,REG," Yeah. Well, what Jesus blatantly fails to appreciate is 
        that it's the meek who are the problem. "
215,JUDITH," Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see. "
216,MANDY," Oh, come on, Brian, or they'll have stoned him before 
        we get there. "
217,BRIAN, All right. 
218,MR. CHEEKY," Hey. Get off her. That's disgusting. Stop trying 
        to do that. Hey, officer, intervene here. Attempted rape going on. It's 
        the chap with the big nose's fault. He started it all. "
219,OFFICER, What? 
220,MANDY," Ohh, I hate wearing these beards. "
221,BRIAN," Why aren't women allowed go to stonings, Mum? "
222,MANDY, It's written. That's why. 
223,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Pssst! Beard, madam? "
224,DONKEY OWNER," Oh, look. I haven't got time to go to no 
        stonings. He's not well again. "
225,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Stones, sir? "
226,MANDY," Naah. They've got a lot there, lying around on the 
        ground. "
227,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Oh, not like these, sir. Look at this. Feel 
        the quality of that. That's craftsmanship, sir. "
228,MANDY," Hmmm. Aah, all right. We'll have, uh, two with points 
        and... a big flat one. "
229,BRIAN," Could I have a flat one, Mum? "
230,MANDY, Shh! 
231,BRIAN, Sorry. Dad. 
232,MANDY," Ehh, all right. Two points, ah, two flats, and a packet 
        of gravel. "
233,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Packet of gravel. Should be a good one this 
        afternoon. "
234,MANDY, Hehh? 
235,HARRY THE HAGGLER, Local boy. 
236,MANDY," Oh, good. "
237,HARRY THE HAGGLER, Enjoy yourselves. 
238,CROWD OF WOMEN, 
239,JEWISH OFFICIAL," Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath,... "
240,MATTHIAS, Do I say 'yes'? 
241,STONE HELPER #1, Yes. 
242,MATTHIAS, Yes. 
243,OFFICIAL," ...you have been found guilty by the elders of the 
        town of uttering the name of our Lord, and so, as a blasphemer,... "
244,CROWD, Ooooh! 
245,OFFICIAL, ...you are to be stoned to death. 
246,CROWD, Ahh! 
247,MATTHIAS," Look. I-- I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to 
        my wife was, 'That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah.' "
248,CROWD, Oooooh! 
249,OFFICIAL, Blasphemy! He's said it again! 
250,CROWD," Yes! Yes, he did! He did!... "
251,OFFICIAL, Did you hear him?! 
252,CROWD," Yes! Yes, we did! We did!... "
253,WOMAN #1, Really! 
254,OFFICIAL, Are there any women here today? 
255,CROWD, No. No. No. No... 
256,OFFICIAL," Very well. By virtue of the authority vested in me--
        "
257,MATTHIAS, Oww! Lay off! We haven't started yet! 
258,OFFICIAL," Come on! Who threw that? Who threw that stone? Come 
        on. "
259,CROWD," She did! She did! He did! He! He. He. Him. Him. Him. 
        Him. He did. "
260,CULPRIT WOMAN, Sorry. I thought we'd started. 
261,OFFICIAL, Go to the back. 
262,CULPRIT WOMAN," Oh, dear. "
263,OFFICIAL," Always one, isn't there? Now, where were we? "
264,MATTHIAS," Look. I don't think it ought to be blasphemy, just 
        saying 'Jehovah'. "
265,CROWD, Oooh! He said it again! Oooh!... 
266,OFFICIAL, You're only making it worse for yourself! 
267,MATTHIAS," Making it worse?! How could it be worse?! Jehovah! 
        Jehovah! Jehovah! "
268,CROWD, Oooooh!... 
269,OFFICIAL, I'm warning you. If you say Jehovah once more...
270,MATTHIAS, 
271,OFFICIAL, Come on. Who threw that? 
272,CROWD," She did! It was her! He! He. Him. Him. Him. Him. Him. 
        Him. "
273,OFFICIAL, Was it you? 
274,MRS. A., Yes. 
275,OFFICIAL, Right! 
276,MRS. A.," Well, you did say 'Jehovah'. "
277,CROWD, Ah! Ooooh!... 
278,OFFICIAL," Stop! Stop, will you?! Stop that! Stop it! Now, 
        look! No one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle! Do you 
        understand?! Even, and I want to make this absolutely clear, even if 
        they do say 'Jehovah'. "
279,CROWD, Ooooooh!... 
280,WOMAN #1, Good shot! 
281,BRIAN," Have I got a big nose, Mum? "
282,MANDY," Oh, stop thinking about sex. "
283,BRIAN, I wasn't. 
284,MANDY," You're always on about it... morning, noon, and night. 
        'Will the girls like this?' 'Will the girls like that?' 'Is it too big?' 
        'Is it too small?' "
285,BRIAN," I was... just wondering if you thought my nose was--
        "
286,MANDY," Get your filthy little mind off it! You're forty years 
        old, now. You should have grown out of all that. "
287,BRIAN," I'm only just getting interested in it, Mum. "
288,MANDY," It's time you got interested in a job, my lad. "
289,LEPER #1, Spare a shekel. 
290,LEPER #2," God bless you, sir. "
291,LEPER #3, Alms for a leper. 
292,LEPER #4, Alms for a leper. 
293,EX-LEPER," Alms for an ex-leper. Bloody donkey owners. All the 
        same, aren't they? Never have any change. Oh, here's a touch. Spare a 
        talent for an old ex-leper. "
294,MANDY, Buzz off! 
295,EX-LEPER, Spare a talent for an old ex-leper. 
296,MANDY, A talent? That's more than he earns in a month. 
297,EX-LEPER," Half a talent, then. "
298,MANDY," No, go away! "
299,EX-LEPER," Come on, Big Nose. Let's haggle. "
300,BRIAN, What? 
301,EX-LEPER," All right. Cut the haggling. Say you open at one 
        shekel. I start at two thousand. We close about eighteen hundred. "
302,BRIAN, No. 
303,EX-LEPER, Seventeen-fifty? 
304,MANDY, Go away! 
305,EX-LEPER, Seventeen-forty. 
306,MANDY, Look. Will you leave him alone? 
307,EX-LEPER," All right. Two shekels. Just two. Isn't this fun, 
        eh? "
308,MANDY," Look. He's not giving you any money, so piss off! "
309,EX-LEPER," All right, sir. My final offer: half a shekel for an 
        old ex-leper. "
310,BRIAN, Did you say... 'ex-leper'? 
311,EX-LEPER," That's right, sir. Sixteen years behind the bell, 
        and proud of it, sir. "
312,BRIAN," Well, what happened? "
313,EX-LEPER," I was cured, sir. "
314,BRIAN, Cured? 
315,EX-LEPER," Yes, sir, a bloody miracle, sir. God bless you. "
316,BRIAN, Who cured you? 
317,EX-LEPER," Jesus did, sir. I was hopping along, minding my own 
        business. All of a sudden, up he comes. Cures me. One minute I'm a leper 
        with a trade, next minute my livelihood's gone. Not so much as a by your 
        leave. 'You're cured mate.' Bloody do-gooder. "
318,BRIAN," Well, why don't you go and tell him you want to be a 
        leper again? "
319,EX-LEPER," Ah, yeah. I could do that, sir. Yeah. Yeah, I could 
        do that, I suppose. What I was thinking was, I was going to ask him if 
        he could make me a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week. 
        You know, something beggable, but not leprosy, which is a pain in the 
        arse, to be blunt. Excuse my French, sir, but, uh-- "
320,MANDY, Brian! Come and clean your room out. 
321,BRIAN, There you are. 
322,EX-LEPER," Thank you, sir. Thanks-- Half a denary for me bloody 
        life story? "
323,BRIAN, There's no pleasing some people. 
324,EX-LEPER," That's just what Jesus said, sir. "
325,MANDY, Oh. 
326,OFFICER, Good afternoon. 
327,MANDY," Oh, ah. Hello, officer. Ehh. I'll be with you in a few 
        moments. All right, dear? "
328,BRIAN, What's he doing here? 
329,MANDY," Now, don't start that Brian, and go and clean your room 
        out. "
330,BRIAN, Bloody Romans. 
331,MANDY," Now, look, Brian. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't 
        have all this, and don't you forget it. "
332,BRIAN," We don't owe the Romans anything, Mum. "
333,MANDY," Well, that's not entirely true, is it Brian? "
334,BRIAN, What do you mean? 
335,MANDY," Well, you know you were asking me about your, uh... "
336,BRIAN, My nose? 
337,MANDY," Yes. Well, there's a reason it's... like it is, Brian.
        "
338,BRIAN, What is it? 
339,MANDY," Well, I suppose I should have told you a long time ago, 
        but... "
340,BRIAN, What? 
341,MANDY," Well, Brian,... your father isn't Mr. Cohen. "
342,BRIAN, I never thought he was. 
343,MANDY," Now, none of your cheek! He was a Roman, Brian. He was 
        a centurion in the Roman army. "
344,BRIAN, You mean... you were raped? 
345,MANDY," Well, at first, yes. "
346,BRIAN, Who was it? 
347,MANDY," Heh. Nortius Maximus his name was. Hmm. Promised me the 
        known world he did. I was to be taken to Rome, House by the Forum. 
        Slaves. Asses' milk. As much gold as I could eat. Then, he, having his 
        way with me had... voom! Like a rat out of an aqueduct. "
348,BRIAN, The bastard! 
349,MANDY," Yeah. So, next time you go on about the 'bloody 
        Romans', don't forget you're one of them. "
350,BRIAN," I'm not a Roman, Mum, and I never will be! I'm a Kike! 
        A Yid! A Hebe! A Hook-nose! I'm Kosher, Mum! I'm a Red Sea Pedestrian, 
        and proud of it! "
351,MANDY," Huh. Sex, sex, sex. That's all they think about, huh? 
        Well, how are you, then, officer? "
352,ANNOUNCER," Ladies and gentlemen. The next contest is 
        between... Frank Goliath, the Macedonian baby-crusher, and Boris 
        Mineburg. "
353,BRIAN, Want some... 
354,VOICE," Thank you, fellows. "
355,BRIAN," Larks' tongues. Wrens' livers. Chaffinch brains. 
        Jaguars' earlobes. Wolf nipple chips. Get 'em while they're hot. They're 
        lovely. Dromedary pretzels, only half a denar. Tuscany fried bats. "
356,JUDITH," I do feel, Reg, that any Anti-Imperialist group like 
        ours must reflect such a divergence of interests within its power-base.
        "
357,REG, Agreed. Francis? 
358,FRANCIS," Yeah. I think Judith's point of view is very valid, 
        Reg, provided the Movement never forgets that it is the inalienable 
        right of every man-- "
359,STAN, Or woman. 
360,FRANCIS, Or woman... to rid himself-- 
361,STAN, Or herself. 
362,FRANCIS, Or herself. 
363,REG, Agreed. 
364,FRANCIS," Thank you, brother. "
365,STAN, Or sister. 
366,FRANCIS, Or sister. Where was I? 
367,REG, I think you'd finished. 
368,FRANCIS, Oh. Right. 
369,REG," Furthermore, it is the birthright of every man-- "
370,STAN, Or woman. 
371,REG," Why don't you shut up about women, Stan. You're putting 
        us off. "
372,STAN," Women have a perfect right to play a part in our 
        movement, Reg. "
373,FRANCIS," Why are you always on about women, Stan? "
374,STAN, I want to be one. 
375,REG, What? 
376,STAN," I want to be a woman. From now on, I want you all to 
        call me 'Loretta'. "
377,REG, What?! 
378,LORETTA, It's my right as a man. 
379,JUDITH," Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan? "
380,LORETTA, I want to have babies. 
381,REG, You want to have babies?! 
382,LORETTA," It's every man's right to have babies if he wants 
        them. "
383,REG, But... you can't have babies. 
384,LORETTA, Don't you oppress me. 
385,REG," I'm not oppressing you, Stan. You haven't got a womb! 
        Where's the foetus going to gestate?! You going to keep it in a box?!
        "
386,LORETTA, 
387,JUDITH," Here! I-- I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he 
        can't actually have babies, not having a womb, which is nobody's fault, 
        not even the Romans', but that he can have the right to have babies. "
388,FRANCIS," Good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors for 
        your right to have babies, brother. Sister. Sorry. "
389,REG, What's the point? 
390,FRANCIS, What? 
391,REG," What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies 
        when he can't have babies?! "
392,FRANCIS," It is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
        "
393,REG, Symbolic of his struggle against reality. 
394,GUARD, Get out there. 
395,BORIS," It's, um-- "
396,GUARD, Get out there. 
397,BORIS, It's dangerous out there. Ah ah. Ah! Oh. 
398,CROWD, Aaah. Ohh... 
399,SPECTATOR, What a load of rubbish. 
400,BRIAN, Larks' tongues. Otters' noses. Ocelot spleens. 
401,REG, Got any nuts? 
402,BRIAN," I haven't got any nuts. Sorry. I've got wrens' livers, 
        badgers' spleens-- "
403,REG," No, no, no. "
404,BRIAN, Otters' noses? 
405,REG, I don't want any of that Roman rubbish. 
406,JUDITH, Why don't you sell proper food? 
407,BRIAN, Proper food? 
408,REG," Yeah, not those rich imperialist tit-bits. "
409,BRIAN," Well, don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this stuff.
        "
410,REG," All right. Bag of otters' noses, then. "
411,FRANCIS, Make it two. 
412,REG, Two. 
413,FRANCIS," Thanks, Reg. "
414,BRIAN, Are you the Judean People's Front? 
415,REG, Fuck off! 
416,BRIAN, What? 
417,REG," Judean People's Front. We're the People's Front of Judea! 
        Judean People's Front. Cawk. "
418,FRANCIS, Wankers. 
419,BRIAN, Can I... join your group? 
420,REG, No. Piss off. 
421,BRIAN," I didn't want to sell this stuff. It's only a job. I 
        hate the Romans as much as anybody. "
422,PEOPLE'S FRONT OF JUDEA, Shhhh. Shhhh. Shhh. Shh. Shhhh. 
423,REG, Stumm. 
424,JUDITH, Are you sure? 
425,BRIAN," Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans already. "
426,REG," Listen. If you wanted to join the P.F.J., you'd have to 
        really hate the Romans. "
427,BRIAN, I do! 
428,REG," Oh, yeah? How much? "
429,BRIAN, A lot! 
430,REG," Right. You're in. Listen. The only people we hate more 
        than the Romans are the fucking Judean People's Front. "
431,P.F.J., Yeah... 
432,JUDITH, Splitters. 
433,P.F.J., Splitters... 
434,FRANCIS, And the Judean Popular People's Front. 
435,P.F.J.," Yeah. Oh, yeah. Splitters. Splitters... "
436,LORETTA, And the People's Front of Judea. 
437,P.F.J., Yeah. Splitters. Splitters... 
438,REG, What? 
439,LORETTA, The People's Front of Judea. Splitters. 
440,REG, We're the People's Front of Judea! 
441,LORETTA, Oh. I thought we were the Popular Front. 
442,REG, People's Front! C-huh. 
443,FRANCIS," Whatever happened to the Popular Front, Reg? "
444,REG, He's over there. 
445,P.F.J., Splitter! 
446,GOLIATH, 
447,SPECTATOR, Absolutely dreadful. Hmm. 
448,CROWD, 
449,REG," Yes, brother! Ha ha. What's your name? "
450,BRIAN, Brian. Brian Cohen. 
451,REG," We may have a little job for you, Brian. "
452,CENTURION," What's this, then? 'Romanes Eunt Domus'? 'People 
        called Romanes they go the house'? "
453,BRIAN," It-- it says, 'Romans, go home'. "
454,CENTURION," No, it doesn't. What's Latin for 'Roman'? Come on!
        "
455,BRIAN, Aah! 
456,CENTURION, Come on! 
457,BRIAN, 'R-- Romanus'? 
458,CENTURION, Goes like...? 
459,BRIAN, 'Annus'? 
460,CENTURION, Vocative plural of 'annus' is...? 
461,BRIAN, Eh. 'Anni'? 
462,CENTURION, 'Romani'. 'Eunt'? What is 'eunt'? 
463,BRIAN, 'Go'. Let-- 
464,CENTURION, Conjugate the verb 'to go'. 
465,BRIAN," Uh. 'Ire'. Uh, 'eo'. 'Is'. 'It'. 'Imus'. 'Itis'. 
        'Eunt'. "
466,CENTURION, So 'eunt' is...? 
467,BRIAN," Ah, huh, third person plural, uh, present indicative. 
        Uh, 'they go'. "
468,CENTURION," But 'Romans, go home' is an order, so you must use 
        the...? "
469,BRIAN, The... imperative! 
470,CENTURION, Which is...? 
471,BRIAN," Umm! Oh. Oh. Um, 'i'. 'I'! "
472,CENTURION, How many Romans? 
473,BRIAN, Ah! 'I'-- Plural. Plural. 'Ite'. 'Ite'. 
474,CENTURION, 'Ite'. 
475,BRIAN, Ah. Eh. 
476,CENTURION, 'Domus'? 
477,BRIAN, Eh. 
478,CENTURION, Nominative? 
479,BRIAN, Oh. 
480,CENTURION," 'Go home'? This is motion towards. Isn't it, boy?
        "
481,BRIAN," Ah. Ah, dative, sir! Ahh! No, not dative! Not the 
        dative, sir! No! Ah! Oh, the... accusative! Accusative! Ah! 'Domum', 
        sir! 'Ad domum'! Ah! Oooh! Ah! "
482,CENTURION, Except that 'domus' takes the...? 
483,BRIAN," The locative, sir! "
484,CENTURION, Which is...?! 
485,BRIAN, 'Domum'. 
486,CENTURION, 'Domum'. 
487,BRIAN, Aaah! Ah. 
488,CENTURION, 'Um'. Understand? 
489,BRIAN," Yes, sir. "
490,CENTURION," Now, write it out a hundred times. "
491,BRIAN," Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar, sir. "
492,CENTURION," Hail Caesar. If it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut 
        your balls off. "
493,BRIAN," Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar and 
        everything, sir! Oh. Mmm! "
494,ROMAN SOLDIER STIG, Right. Now don't do it again. 
495,MAN, Hey! Bloody Romans. 
496,FRANCIS," We're gettin' in through the underground heating 
        system here, up through into the main audience chamber here, and 
        Pilate's wife's bedroom is here. Having grabbed his wife, we inform 
        Pilate that she is in our custody and forthwith issue our demands. Any 
        questions? "
497,COMMANDO XERXES, What exactly are the demands? 
498,REG," We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle the entire 
        apparatus of the Roman Imperialist State, and if he doesn't agree 
        immediately, we execute her. "
499,MATTHIAS, Cut her head off? 
500,FRANCIS," Cut all her bits off. Send 'em back on the hour every 
        hour. Show them we're not to be trifled with. "
501,REG," Also, we're demanding a ten foot mahogany statue of the 
        Emperor Julius Caesar with his dock hangin' out. "
502,P.F.J., 
503,LORETTA," What? They'll never agree to that, Reg. "
504,REG," That's just a bar-- a bargaining counter. And of course, 
        we point out that they bear full responsibility when we chop her up, and 
        that we shall not submit to blackmail! "
505,COMMANDOS, No blackmail! 
506,REG," They've bled us white, the bastards. They've taken 
        everything we had, and not just from us, from our fathers, and from our 
        fathers' fathers. "
507,LORETTA, And from our fathers' fathers' fathers. 
508,REG, Yeah. 
509,LORETTA, And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers. 
510,REG," Yeah. All right, Stan. Don't labour the point. And what 
        have they ever given us in return?! "
511,XERXES, The aqueduct? 
512,REG, What? 
513,XERXES, The aqueduct. 
514,REG," Oh. Yeah, yeah. They did give us that. Uh, that's true. 
        Yeah. "
515,COMMANDO #3, And the sanitation. 
516,LORETTA," Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city 
        used to be like? "
517,REG," Yeah. All right. I'll grant you the aqueduct and the 
        sanitation are two things that the Romans have done. "
518,MATTHIAS, And the roads. 
519,REG," Well, yeah. Obviously the roads. I mean, the roads go 
        without saying, don't they? But apart from the sanitation, the aqueduct, 
        and the roads-- "
520,COMMANDO, Irrigation. 
521,XERXES, Medicine. 
522,COMMANDOS, Huh? Heh? Huh... 
523,COMMANDO #2, Education. 
524,COMMANDOS, Ohh... 
525,REG," Yeah, yeah. All right. Fair enough. "
526,COMMANDO #1, And the wine. 
527,COMMANDOS," Oh, yes. Yeah... "
528,FRANCIS," Yeah. Yeah, that's something we'd really miss, Reg, 
        if the Romans left. Huh. "
529,COMMANDO, Public baths. 
530,LORETTA," And it's safe to walk in the streets at night now, 
        Reg. "
531,FRANCIS," Yeah, they certainly know how to keep order. Let's 
        face it. They're the only ones who could in a place like this. "
532,COMMANDOS," Hehh, heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh. "
533,REG," All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, 
        education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, 
        and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us? "
534,XERXES, Brought peace. 
535,REG, Oh. Peace? Shut up! 
536,MATTHIAS," I am a poor man. My sight is poor. My legs are old 
        and bent, and-- "
537,JUDITH," It's all right, Matthias. "
538,MATTHIAS, It's all clear. 
539,JUDITH," Well, where's Reg? "
540,FRANCIS," Oh, Reg. Reg, it's Judith. "
541,REG, What went wrong? 
542,JUDITH, The first blow has been struck! 
543,REG, Did he finish the slogan? 
544,JUDITH," A hundred times, in letters ten foot high, all the way 
        around the palace! "
545,REG," Oh, great. Great. We-- we need doers in our movement, 
        Brian, but, before you join us, know this. There is not one of us here 
        who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country of the Romans once 
        and for all. "
546,COMMANDO," Uhh. Well, one. "
547,REG," Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one, but otherwise, we're solid. 
        Are you with us? "
548,BRIAN, Yes! 
549,REG," From now on, you shall be called 'Brian that is called 
        Brian'. Tell him about the raid on Pilate's palace, Francis. "
550,FRANCIS, Right. This is the plan... 
551,FRANCIS," Now, this is the palace in Caesar's Square. Our 
        commando unit will approach from Fish Street, under cover of night, and 
        make our way to the northwestern main drain. If questioned, we are 
        sewage workers on our way to a conference. Reg, our glorious leader and 
        founder of the P.F.J., will be coordinating consultant at the drain 
        head, though he himself will not be taking part in any terrorist action, 
        as he has a bad back. "
552,BRIAN, Aren't you going to come with us? 
553,REG," Solidarity, brother. "
554,BRIAN," Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg. "
555,FRANCIS," Once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence. 
        There is a Roman feast later in the evening, so we must move fast, and 
        don't wear your best sandals. Turning left here, we enter the 
        Caesar-Augustus memorial sewer and from there, proceed directly to the 
        hypocaust. This has just been re-tiled, so terrorists, careful with 
        those weapons. We will now be directly beneath Pilate's audience chamber 
        itself. This is the moment for Habbakuk to get out his prong. "
556,CAMPAIGN FOR FREE GALILEE, Shhh! Shh. Shhh. Shh. 
557,DEADLY DIRK, Campaign for Free Galilee. 
558,FRANCIS," Oh. Uh, People's Front of Judea. Officials. "
559,DEADLY DIRK, Oh. 
560,FRANCIS, What's your group doing here? 
561,DEADLY DIRK," We're going to kidnap Pilate's wife, take her 
        back, issue demands. "
562,FRANCIS, So are we. 
563,DEADLY DIRK, What? 
564,FRANCIS, That's our plan! 
565,DEADLY DIRK, We were here first! 
566,FRANCIS, What do you mean?! 
567,DEADLY DIRK, We thought of it first! 
568,WARRIS," Oh, yeah? "
569,DEADLY DIRK," Yes, a couple of years ago! "
570,P.F.J., Ha. Heh. Ha ha. 
571,DEADLY DIRK, We did! 
572,FRANCIS," Okay, c-- co-- come on. You got all your demands 
        worked out, then? "
573,DEADLY DIRK, 'Course we have. 
574,FRANCIS, What are they? 
575,DEADLY DIRK," Well, I'm not telling you. "
576,P.F.J., Aghhh... 
577,FRANCIS," Oh, come on. Pull the other one. "
578,P.F.J., Shh! 
579,DEADLY DIRK," That's not the point! We thought of it before 
        you! "
580,WARRIS, Did not. 
581,DEADLY DIRK, We did! 
582,FRANCIS, You didn't. 
583,C.F.G., We bloody did! 
584,BRIAN, Shhhh! 
585,P.F.J., Shhhhh! Shh. 
586,DEADLY DIRK," You bastards! We've been planning this for 
        months. "
587,FRANCIS," Well, tough titty for you, Fish Face. Oh! Oh. "
588,RANDOM, All right. 
589,WARRIS, Clever. You sly... 
590,BRIAN," Brothers! Brothers! We should be struggling together!
        "
591,FRANCIS, We are! Ohh. 
592,BRIAN," We mustn't fight each other! Surely we should be united 
        against the common enemy! "
593,EVERYONE, The Judean People's Front?! 
594,BRIAN," No, no! The Romans! "
595,EVERYONE," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. "
596,FRANCIS," Yeah. He's right. Let's go in, get her out, and we 
        can argue afterwards. "
597,DEADLY DIRK, All right. 
598,RANDOM, Yeah. 
599,FRANCIS, Promise. 
600,RANDOM, Yeah. 
601,DEADLY DIRK, Solidarity! 
602,RANDOM, Solidarity. 
603,EVERYONE, Solidarity. 
604,RANDOM, Ahh. 
605,RANDOM, Let's go get her. 
606,COMMANDOS, Oh. Oh! Oh! Ohhh! Aaahh! Waahh! Ooh...

619,RANDOM, Careful. 
620,DEADLY DIRK, Right! Where were we? 
621,FRANCIS," Uhh, you were going to punch me. "

630,BEN, You lucky bastard. 
631,BRIAN, Who's that? 
632,BEN," You lucky, lucky bastard. "
633,BRIAN, What? 
634,BEN," Proper little jailer's pet, aren't we? "
635,BRIAN, What do you mean? 
636,BEN," You must have slipped him a few shekels, eh? "
637,BRIAN," Slipped him a few shekels? You saw him spit in my face!
        "
638,BEN," Ohh! What wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face! I 
        sometimes hang awake at night dreaming of being spat at in the face. "
639,BRIAN," Well, it's not exactly friendly, is it? They had me in 
        manacles! "
640,BEN," Manacles! Ooh oooh oh oh. My idea of heaven is to be 
        allowed to be put in manacles... just for a few hours. They must think 
        the sun shines out o' your arse, sonny. "
641,BRIAN," Oh, lay off me. I've had a hard time! "
642,BEN," You've had a hard time?! I've been here five years! They 
        only hung me the right way up yesterday! So, don't you come 'rou-- "
643,BRIAN, All right. All right. 
644,BEN, They must think you're Lord God Almighty. 
645,BRIAN, What will they do to me? 
646,BEN," Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion. "
647,BRIAN, Crucifixion?! 
648,BEN," Yeah, first offence. "
649,BRIAN, Get away with crucifixion?! It's-- 
650,BEN, Best thing the Romans ever did for us. 
651,BRIAN, What?! 
652,BEN," Oh, yeah. If we didn't have crucifixion, this country 
        would be in a right bloody mess. "
653,BRIAN, Guards! 
654,BEN," Nail him up, I say! "
655,BRIAN, Guards! 
656,BEN, Nail some sense into him! 
657,JAILER, 
658,BRIAN, I want you to move me to another cell. 
659,JAILER, Ha! 
660,BRIAN, Aah! 
661,BEN," Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism! "
662,JAILER," Shut up, you! "
663,BEN, Sorry! 
664,JAILER, Huhh. 
665,BEN," Now, take my case. They hung me up here five years ago. 
        Every night, they take me down for twenty minutes, then they hang me up 
        again, which I regard as very fair, in view of what I done, and, if 
        nothing else, it's taught me to respect the Romans, and it's taught 
        me... that you'll never get anywhere in this life, unless you're 
        prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay! "
666,BRIAN," Oh, shut up! "
667,JAILER, Ehhh. 
668,CENTURION, Pilate wants to see you! 
669,BRIAN, Me? 
670,CENTURION, Come on! 
671,BRIAN, Pilate? What does he want to see me for? 
672,CENTURION," I think he wants to know which way up you want to 
        be crucified. "
673,BEN," Oh, ha ha ha haa! Ha haa! Nice one, Centurion. Like it. 
        Like it. "
674,CENTURION, Shut up! 
675,BEN," Right. Right. Terrific race, the Romans. Terrific.

763,HARRY THE HAGGLER," What do you mean, 'no, no, no'? "
764,BRIAN, I haven't time. I've got-- 
765,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Well, give it back, then. "
766,BRIAN," No, no, no. I just paid you. "
767,HARRY THE HAGGLER, Burt! 
768,BURT, Yeah? 
769,HARRY THE HAGGLER, This bloke won't haggle. 
770,BURT, Won't haggle?! 
771,BRIAN, All right. Do we have to? 
772,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Now, look. I want twenty for that. "
773,BRIAN, I-- I just gave you twenty. 
774,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Now, are you telling me that's not worth 
        twenty shekels? "
775,BRIAN, No. 
776,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Look at it. Feel the quality. That's none 
        of your goat. "
777,BRIAN, All right. I'll give you nineteen then. 
778,HARRY THE HAGGLER," No, no, no. Come on. Do it properly. "
779,BRIAN, What? 
780,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Haggle properly. This isn't worth nineteen.
        "
781,BRIAN," Well, you just said it was worth twenty. "
782,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Ohh, dear. Ohh, dear. Come on. Haggle. "
783,BRIAN, Huh. All right. I'll give you ten. 
784,HARRY THE HAGGLER," That's more like it. Ten?! Are you trying 
        to insult me?! Me, with a poor dying grandmother?! Ten?! "
785,BRIAN, All right. I'll give you eleven. 
786,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Now you're gettin' it. Eleven?! Did I hear 
        you right?! Eleven?! This cost me twelve. You want to ruin me?! "
787,BRIAN, Seventeen? 
788,HARRY THE HAGGLER," No, no, no, no. Seventeen. "
789,BRIAN, Eighteen? 
790,HARRY THE HAGGLER," No, no. You go to fourteen now. "

807,BURT, Yeah? 
808,BRIAN, All right! All right. All right. 
809,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Now, where's the sixteen you owe me? "
810,BRIAN, I just gave you twenty. 
811,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Oh, yeah. That's right. That's four I owe 
        you, then. "
812,BRIAN," Well, that's all right. That's fine. That's fine. "
813,HARRY THE HAGGLER," No. Hang on. I've got it here somewhere.
        "
814,BRIAN, That's all right. That's four for the gourd. 
815,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Four? For this gourd? Four?! Look at it. 
        It's worth ten if it's worth a shekel. "
816,BRIAN, But you just gave it to me for nothing. 
817,HARRY THE HAGGLER," Yes, but it's worth ten! "
818,BRIAN, All right. All right. 
819,HARRY THE HAGGLER," No, no, no, no. It's not worth ten. You're

851,MATTHIAS, Yes.

        Brian of Nazareth, a member of the terrorist organisation, the 'People's 
        Front of Judea'. "
853,MATTHIAS," Me? No. I'm just a poor old man. I have no time for

        bent. "
854,CENTURION, Quiet! Silly person. Guards! Search the house.

856,CENTURION, Crucifixion. 
857,MATTHIAS, Oh. 
858,CENTURION," Nasty, eh? "
859,MATTHIAS, Hm. Could be worse. 
860,CENTURION," What do you mean, 'could be worse'? "
861,MATTHIAS," Well, you could be stabbed. "
862,CENTURION," Stabbed? Takes a second. Crucifixion lasts hours! 
        It's a slow, horrible death! "
863,MATTHIAS," Well, at least it gets you out in the open air. "
864,CENTURION, You're weird. 
865,SERGEANT," No, sir. Couldn't find anything, sir. "
866,CENTURION," But don't worry! You've not seen the last of us, 
        weirdo. "
867,MATTHIAS, Big Nose. 
868,CENTURION, Watch it. 
869,MATTHIAS," Phew, that was lucky. "
870,BRIAN," I'm sorry, Reg. "
871,REG," Ohhh, it's all right, siblings. He's sorry. He's sorry he 
        led the Fifth Legion straight to our official headquarters. Well, that's 
        all right, then, Brian. Sit down. Have a scone. Make yourself at home. 
        You klutz! You stupid, bird-brained, flat-headed-- "
872,BORING PROPHET," ...this great, big, juicy melon behind. "
873,MATTHIAS," My legs are old and bent. My ears are grizzled. Yes?
        "
874,CENTURION, There's one place we didn't look. Guards! 
875,MATTHIAS, I'm just a poor old man. 
876,CENTURION, Have you ever seen anyone crucified? 
877,MATTHIAS, Crucifixion's a doddle. 
878,CENTURION, Don't keep saying that. 
879,SERGEANT," Found this spoon, sir. "
880,CENTURION," Well done, Sergeant! We'll be back,... oddball. "
881,MATTHIAS, You haven't given us time to hide. 
882,BRIAN, Aaaaah! 
883,BORING PROPHET, ...The nephew or the donkey. 
884,FALSE PROPHET," ...And, a nine-bladed sword, which he shall

890,BRIAN," Don't you, eh, pass judgment on other people, or you 
        might get judged yourself. "
891,COLIN, What? 
892,BRIAN," I said, 'Don't pass judgment on other people, or else 
        you might get judged, too.' "
893,COLIN," Who, me? "
894,BRIAN, Yes. 
895,COLIN, Oh. Ooh. Thank you very much. 
896,BRIAN," Well, not just you. All of you. "
897,DENNIS, That's a nice gourd. 
898,BRIAN, What? 
899,DENNIS, How much do you want for the gourd? 
900,BRIAN, I don't. You can have it. 
901,DENNIS, Have it? 
902,BRIAN, Yes. Consider the lilies... 
903,DENNIS," Eh, d-- d-- don't you want to haggle? "
904,BRIAN, No. ...in the field. 
905,DENNIS," What's wrong with it, then? "
906,BRIAN, Nothing. Take it. 
907,ELSIE, Consider the lilies? 
908,BRIAN," Uh, well, the birds, then. "
909,EDDIE, What birds? 
910,BRIAN, Any birds. 
911,EDDIE, Why? 
912,BRIAN," Well, have they got jobs? "
913,ARTHUR, Who? 
914,BRIAN, The birds. 
915,EDDIE, Have the birds got jobs?! 
916,FRANK, What's the matter with him? 
917,ARTHUR, He says the birds are scrounging. 
918,BRIAN," Oh, uhh, no, the point is the birds. They do all right. 
        Don't they? "
919,FRANK," Well, good luck to 'em. "
920,EDDIE, Yeah. They're very pretty. 
921,BRIAN," Okay, and you're much more important than they are, 
        right? So, what are you worrying about? There you are. See? "
922,EDDIE, I'm worrying about what you have got against birds. 
923,BRIAN," I haven't got anything against the birds. Consider the 
        lilies. "
924,ARTHUR, He's having a go at the flowers now. 
925,EDDIE," Oh, give the flowers a chance. "
926,DENNIS, I'll give you one for it. 
927,BRIAN, It's yours. 
928,DENNIS," Two, then. "
929,BRIAN," Ohh. Look. There was this man, and he had two servants.
        "
930,ARTHUR, What were they called? 
931,BRIAN, What? 
932,ARTHUR, What were their names? 
933,BRIAN, I don't know. And he gave them some talents. 
934,EDDIE, You don't know?! 
935,BRIAN," Well, it doesn't matter! "
936,ARTHUR, He doesn't know what they were called! 
937,BRIAN," Oh, they were called 'Simon' and 'Adrian'. Now-- "
938,ARTHUR, Oh! You said... 
939,EDDIE, Ohh. 
940,ARTHUR, ...you didn't know! 
941,BRIAN," It really doesn't matter. The point is there were these 
        two servants-- "
942,ARTHUR, He's making it up as he goes along. 
943,BRIAN," No, I'm not! ...And he gave them some ta-- Wait a 
        minute. Were there three? "
944,ARTHUR, Ohh. 
945,EDDIE," Oh, he's terrible! "
946,ARTHUR, He's terrible. 
947,BRIAN, There were three. 
948,ARTHUR, Thpppt! 
949,BRIAN," They were-- they were st-- stewards, really. "
950,ELSIE," Aww, get off! "
951,BRIAN," Ooh! Eh, uh, b-- b-- now-- now hear this! Blessed are 
        they... "
952,DENNIS, Three. 
953,BRIAN," ...who convert their neighbor's ox, for they shall 
        inhibit their girth,... "
954,MAN, Rubbish! 
955,BRIAN," ...and to them only shall be given-- to them only... 
        shall... be... given... "
956,ELSIE, What? 
957,BRIAN, Hmm? 
958,ELSIE, Shall be given what? 
959,BRIAN," Oh, nothing. "
960,EDDIE, Ahh. 
961,ELSIE, Hey! What were you going to say? 
962,BRIAN, Nothing. 
963,ARTHUR and FRANK," Yes, you were. "
964,ELSIE, Yes. You were going to say something. 
965,BRIAN," No, I wasn't. I'd finished. "
966,ELSIE," Oh, no you weren't. "
967,ARTHUR," Oh, come on. Tell us before you go. "
968,BRIAN, I wasn't going to say anything. I'd finished. 
969,ELSIE," No, you hadn't. "
970,BLIND MAN, What won't he tell? 
971,EDDIE, He won't say. 
972,BLIND MAN, Is it a secret? 
973,BRIAN, No. 
974,BLIND MAN, Is it? 
975,EDDIE," Must be. Otherwise, he'd tell us. "
976,ARTHUR," Oh, tell us the secret. "
977,BRIAN, Leave me alone. 
978,YOUTH, What is this secret? 
979,GIRL, Is it the secret of eternal life? 
980,EDDIE, He won't say! 
981,ARTHUR," Well, of course not. If I knew the secret of eternal 
        life, I wouldn't say. "
982,YOUTH, No. 
983,BRIAN, Leave me alone. 
984,GIRL," Just tell me, please. "
985,ARTHUR," No. Tell us, Master. We were here first. "
986,DENNIS, Five. 
987,BRIAN, Ah! 
988,GIRL, Just tell-- 
989,BRIAN, Go away! 
990,GIRL," Tell us, Master. "
991,DENNIS, I can't go above five. 
992,GIRL, Tell-- Is that His gourd? 
993,YOUTH, We've got this here. 
994,DENNIS," Yeah, but it's under offer. "
995,GIRL, This is His gourd! 
996,DENNIS, Ten! 
997,GIRL," It is His gourd! We will carry it for you, Master! 
        Master? "
998,YOUTH, He's gone! He's been taken up! 
999,GIRL, Hhhh! 
1000,FOLLOWERS, For He's been taken up! 
1001,DENNIS, Eighteen! 
1002,ARTHUR," No, there He is. Over there. "
1003,FOLLOWERS," Oh, yeah. Master! Master!... "
1004,FOLLOWERS, ...Look! Ah! Oh! Oh! 
1005,ARTHUR, He has given us a sign! 
1006,FOLLOWER, Oh! 
1007,SHOE FOLLOWER, He has given us... His shoe! 
1008,ARTHUR, The shoe is the sign. Let us follow His example. 
1009,SPIKE, What? 
1010,ARTHUR," Let us, like Him, hold up one shoe and let the other 
        be upon our foot, for this is His sign, that all who follow Him shall do 
        likewise. "
1011,EDDIE, Yes. 
1012,SHOE FOLLOWER," No, no, no. The shoe is... "
1013,YOUTH, No. 
1014,SHOE FOLLOWER," ...a sign that we must gather shoes together in 
        abundance. "
1015,GIRL, Cast off... 
1016,SPIKE, Aye. What? 
1017,GIRL, ...the shoes! Follow the Gourd! 
1018,SHOE FOLLOWER, No! Let us gather shoes together! 
1019,FRANK, Yes. 
1020,SHOE FOLLOWER, Let me! 
1021,ELSIE," Oh, get off! "
1022,YOUTH," No, no! It is a sign that, like Him, we must think not 
        of the things of the body, but of the face and head! "
1023,SHOE FOLLOWER, Give me your shoe! 
1024,YOUTH, Get off! 
1025,GIRL, Follow the Gourd! The Holy Gourd of Jerusalem! 
1026,FOLLOWER, The Gourd! 
1027,HARRY," Hold up the sandal, as He has commanded us! "
1028,ARTHUR, It is a shoe! It is a shoe! 
1029,HARRY, It's a sandal! 
1030,ARTHUR," No, it isn't! "
1031,GIRL, Cast it away! 
1032,ARTHUR, Put it on! 
1033,YOUTH, And clear off! 
1034,SHOE FOLLOWER, Take the shoes and follow Him! 
1035,GIRL," Come,... "
1036,FRANK, Yes! 
1037,GIRL, ...all ye who call yourself Gourdenes! 
1038,SPIKE," Stop! Stop! Stop, I say! Stop! Let us-- let us pray. 
        Yea, He cometh to us, like the seed to the grain. "
1039,FOLLOWERS, ...Master! Master! Look! Master! Master!... 
1040,BRIAN," Hey! Is there another way down? Is there another path 
        down to the river? "
1041,SIMON THE HOLY MAN, Mmmmmmm. 
1042,BRIAN, Please! Please help me! I've got to get-- 
1043,SIMON, Mm. 
1044,BRIAN, Shhhh. 
1045,SIMON," Oh, damn, damn, damn! "
1046,BRIAN," Well, I'm sorry. Shhh. "
1047,SIMON," Oh, damn, damn, and blast it! "
1048,BRIAN, I'm sorry. Shhhh! 
1049,SIMON," Don't you 'shhhh' me. Eighteen years of total silence, 
        and you 'shhhh' me! "
1050,BRIAN, What? 
1051,SIMON," I've kept my vow for eighteen years. Not a single, 
        recognisable, articulate sound has passed my lips. "
1052,BRIAN," Oh, please. Could you be quiet for another five 
        minutes? "
1053,SIMON," Oh, it doesn't matter now. I might as well enjoy 
        myself. The times in the last eighteen years I've wanted to shout and 
        sing and... "
1054,BRIAN, Shhhh. 
1055,SIMON," ...scream my name out! Oh, I'm alive! "
1056,BRIAN, Shhh. 
1057,SIMON, Hava Nagila! 
1058,BRIAN, Shhh. 
1059,SIMON," Hava Nagila! Hava Nagila, ha ha ha! Look out. Oh, I'm 
        alive! I'm alive! Hello birds! Hello trees! I'm alive! Get off. I'm 
        alive! Hava Nagila. Hava n'ra n'-- "
1060,FOLLOWERS, Master! The Master! Master! Master!... 
1061,SHOE FOLLOWER, The Master! Aha. He is here! 
1062,FRANK, Master! 
1063,ELSIE, The Gourd has led us... 
1064,ARTHUR, The shoe has led us to Him! 
1065,FOLLOWERS, The shoe!... 
1066,ARTHUR, The shoe has brought us! 
1067,ARTHUR and HARRY, Speak! 
1068,FOLLOWERS, Shhhhh! 
1069,ARTHUR and HARRY," Speak to us, Master! Speak to us! "
1070,BRIAN, Go away! 
1071,FOLLOWERS, A blessing! A blessing! 
1072,ARTHUR," How shall we go away, Master?! "
1073,BRIAN," Oh, just go away! Leave me alone! "
1074,SHOE FOLLOWER, Give us a sign! 
1075,ARTHUR," He has given us a sign! He has brought us to this 
        place! "
1076,BRIAN, I didn't bring you here! You just followed me! 
1077,SHOE FOLLOWER," Oh, it's still a good sign by any standard. "
1078,ARTHUR," Master! Your people have walked many miles to be with 
        You! They are weary and have not eaten. "
1079,BRIAN, It's not my fault they haven't eaten! 
1080,ARTHUR, There is no food in this high mountain! 
1081,BRIAN," Well, what about the juniper bushes over there? "
1082,ELSIE, Hhhh! 
1083,FOLLOWERS, Heh! A miracle! A miracle! Ohh!... 
1084,SHOE FOLLOWER, He has made the bush fruitful by His words. 
1085,YOUTH, They have brought forth juniper berries. 
1086,BRIAN," Of course they've brought forth juniper berries! 
        They're juniper bushes! What do you expect?! "
1087,ELSIE, Show us another miracle! 
1088,ARTHUR," Do not tempt Him, shallow ones! Is not the miracle of 
        the juniper bushes enough?! "
1089,SIMON," I say, those are my juniper bushes. "
1090,ARTHUR, They are a gift from God! 
1091,SIMON," They're all I've bloody got to eat. Uhm. I say, get off 
        those bushes! Go on! Clear off, the lot of you. Go on. "
1092,HARRY, Lord! I am affected by a bald patch. 
1093,BLIND MAN, I am healed! The Master has healed me! 
1094,BRIAN, I didn't touch him! 
1095,BLIND MAN," I was blind, and now I can see! Aargh! "
1096,FOLLOWERS, A miracle! A miracle! A miracle! 
1097,SIMON," Tell them to stop it. I hadn't said a word for eighteen 
        years till he came along. "
1098,ELSIE, Hhh! 
1099,FOLLOWERS, A miracle! He is the Messiah! 
1100,SIMON," Well, he hurt my foot! "
1101,FOLLOWERS," Hurt my foot, Lord! Hurt my foot. Hurt mine... "
1102,ARTHUR, Hail Messiah! 
1103,BRIAN, I'm not the Messiah! 
1104,ARTHUR," I say You are, Lord, and I should know. I've followed 
        a few. "
1105,FOLLOWERS, Hail Messiah! 
1106,BRIAN," I'm not the Messiah! Will you please listen? I am not 
        the Messiah, do you understand?! Honestly! "
1107,GIRL, Only the true Messiah denies His divinity. 
1108,BRIAN," What?! Well, what sort of chance does that give me? All 
        right! I am the Messiah! "
1109,FOLLOWERS, He is! He is the Messiah! 
1110,BRIAN," Now, fuck off! "
1111,ARTHUR," How shall we fuck off, O Lord? "
1112,BRIAN," Oh, just go away! Leave me alone. "
1113,SIMON," You told these people to eat my juniper berries. You 
        break my bloody foot. You break my vow of silence, and then you try and 
        clean up on my juniper bushes! "
1114,BRIAN," Oh, lay off! "
1115,ARTHUR," This is the Messiah, the Chosen One! "
1116,SIMON," No, he's not. "
1117,BRIAN, Aaaagh! 
1118,ARTHUR, An unbeliever! 
1119,FOLLOWERS, An unbeliever! 
1120,ARTHUR, Persecute! Kill the heretic! 
1121,FOLLOWERS, Kill the heretic! Kill him! Persecute! Kill!... 
1122,BRIAN," Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Leave him alone. Put 
        him down. Please! "
1123,JUDITH, Brian? 
1124,BRIAN, Judith? 
1125,FOLLOWERS, Look! There He is! The Chosen One has woken! 
1126,MANDY, Brian! 
1127,BRIAN, Huuh. Hooh. Ooh! Mother. Ooh. Ha-- 
1128,MANDY, Brian! 
1129,BRIAN," Hang on, mother! Shhh. "
1130,MANDY," Don't you 'hello mother' me. What are all those people 
        doing out there?! "
1131,BRIAN," Oh. Well-- well, I, uh-- "
1132,MANDY," Come on! What have you been up to, my lad?! "
1133,BRIAN," Well, uh, I think they must have popped by for 
        something. "
1134,MANDY," 'Popped by'?! 'Swarmed by', more like! There's a 
        multitude out there! "
1135,BRIAN," Mm, they-- they started following me yesterday. "
1136,MANDY," Well, they can stop following you right now. Now, stop 
        following my son! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. "
1137,FOLLOWERS, The Messiah! The Messiah! Show us the Messiah! 
1138,MANDY, The who? 
1139,FOLLOWERS, The Messiah! 
1140,MANDY," Huh, there's no Messiah in here. There's a mess, all 
        right, but no Messiah. Now, go away! "
1141,FOLLOWERS, Brian! Brian! 
1142,MANDY," Right, my lad. What have you been up to? "
1143,BRIAN," Nothing, Mum. Um-- "
1144,MANDY, Come on. Out with it. 
1145,BRIAN," Well, they think I'm the Messiah, Mum. "
1146,MANDY," Now, what have you been telling them? "
1147,BRIAN, Nothing! I only-- 
1148,MANDY, You're only making it worse for yourself. 
1149,BRIAN, Look! I can explain! I-- 
1150,JUDITH," No! Let me explain, Mrs. Cohen! "
1151,MANDY, Who-- 
1152,JUDITH," Your son is a born leader. Those people out there are 
        following him because they believe in him, Mrs. Cohen. They believe he 
        can give them hope-- hope of a new life, a new world, a better future!
        "
1153,MANDY, Who's that?! 
1154,BRIAN," Oh! That's... Judith, Mum. Judith. Mother. Hmm. "
1155,FOLLOWERS, The Messiah! The Messiah! 
1156,MANDY, Ooooh. 
1157,FOLLOWERS," Show us the Messiah! The Messiah! The Messiah! Show 
        us the Messiah! "
1158,MANDY," Now, you listen here! He's not the Messiah. He's a very 
        naughty boy! Now, go away! "
1159,FOLLOWERS, Who are you?! 
1160,MANDY, I'm his mother. That's who. 
1161,FOLLOWERS," Behold His mother! Behold His mother! Hail to thee, 
        mother of Brian! Blessed art thou, Hosanna! All praise to thee, now and 
        always! "
1162,MANDY," Well-- Now, don't think you can get around me like 
        that. He's not coming out, and that's my final word. Now, shove off! "
1163,FOLLOWERS, No! 
1164,MANDY, Did you hear what I said? 
1165,FOLLOWERS, Yes! 
1166,MANDY," Oh, I see. It-- it's like that, is it? "
1167,FOLLOWERS, Yes! 
1168,MANDY," Ohh. Oh, all right, then. You can see him for one 
        minute, but not one second more. Do you understand? "
1169,FOLLOWERS, Yes. 
1170,MANDY, Promise? 
1171,FOLLOWERS," Well, all right. "
1172,MANDY," All right. Here he is, then. Come on, Brian. Come and 
        talk to them. "
1173,BRIAN," But, Mum. Judith. "
1174,MANDY," Now, leave that Welsh tart alone. "
1175,BRIAN," But I don't really want to, Mum. "
1176,FOLLOWERS, Brian! Brian! Brian!... 
1177,BRIAN, Good morning. 
1178,FOLLOWERS, A blessing! A blessing! A blessing!... 
1179,BRIAN," No. No, please! Please! Please listen. I've got one or 
        two things to say. "
1180,FOLLOWERS, Tell us. Tell us both of them. 
1181,BRIAN," Look. You've got it all wrong. You don't need to follow 
        me. You don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for 
        yourselves. You're all individuals! "
1182,FOLLOWERS," Yes, we're all individuals! "
1183,BRIAN, You're all different! 
1184,FOLLOWERS," Yes, we are all different! "
1185,DENNIS, I'm not. 
1186,ARTHUR, Shhhh. 
1187,FOLLOWERS, Shh. Shhhh. Shhh. 
1188,BRIAN, You've all got to work it out for yourselves! 
1189,FOLLOWERS, Yes! We've got to work it out for ourselves! 
1190,BRIAN, Exactly! 
1191,FOLLOWERS, Tell us more! 
1192,BRIAN," No! That's the point! Don't let anyone tell you what to 
        do! Otherwise-- Ow! No! "
1193,MANDY," Come on, Brian. That's enough. That's enough. "
1194,FOLLOWERS, Oooooh. That wasn't a minute! 
1195,MANDY," Oh, yes, it was. "
1196,FOLLOWERS," Oh, no, it wasn't! "
1197,MANDY," Now, stop that, and go away! "
1198,YOUTH, Excuse me. 
1199,MANDY, Yes? 
1200,YOUTH, Are you a virgin? 
1201,MANDY, I beg your pardon! 
1202,YOUTH," Well, if it's not a personal question, are you a 
        virgin? "
1203,MANDY," 'If it's not a personal question'? How much more 
        personal can you get? Now, piss off! "
1204,YOUTH, She is. 
1205,FOLLOWERS, Yeah. Must be. She is. Definitely... 
1206,CROWD, Ooh. Oh! Oooh... 
1207,REG," 'Morning, Saviour. "
1208,CROWD, 
1209,WOMAN, Lay Your hands on me. Quick! 
1210,FRANCIS," Now, don't jostle the Chosen One, please. "
1211,BABY, 
1212,REG," Don't push that baby in the Saviour's face. You've got 
        till later. "
1213,GREGORY," I say. I say, could He just see my wife? She has a 
        headache. "
1214,REG," She'll have to wait, I'm afraid. "
1215,GREGORY," It's very bad, and we've got a luncheon appointment.
        "
1216,REG," Look, the lepers are queuing. "
1217,GREGORY," Her brother-in-law is the ex-mayor of Bath, you know.
        "
1218,REG," Uh, Brian, can I introduce the gentleman who's letting us 
        have the Mounts on Sunday? "
1219,MR. PAPADOPOULOS, Hello. 
1220,FRANCIS, Don't push! 
1221,REG," And keep the noise down, please! Those possessed by 
        devils, try and keep them under control a bit, can't you? All right. 
        Now, those with gifts come forward, please. Incurables, you'll just have 
        to wait for a few minutes. "
1222,MAN, Will he endorse fish? 
1223,REG," Ahh, you'll have to speak to your sibling Francis about 
        endorsements. Now don't-- "
1224,REG," Line up along there. Now get 'em in two rows, Reg. Ahh--
        "
1225,OTTO," Hail, Leader! "
1226,BRIAN, What? 
1227,OTTO," Oh, I-- I'm so sorry. Have you see ze new Leader? "
1228,BRIAN, The what? 
1229,OTTO," The new Leader. I-- I wish to find him and hail him. 
        Hail, Leader. See? "
1230,BRIAN, Who are you? 
1231,OTTO," Uh, my name is... Otto. "
1232,BRIAN, Oh. Otto. 
1233,OTTO, Yes. 
1234,BRIAN," Well, I'm not sure, but I-- "
1235,OTTO," Oh, I grow so impatient, you know. To see the Leader 
        that has been promised our people for centuries. The Leader who will 
        save Israel by ridding it of the scum of non-Jewish people, "
1236,BRIAN, Shh! Otto! 
1237,OTTO, What? The Leader? Hail Leader! 
1238,BRIAN," No, no; it's dangerous. "
1239,OTTO, Oh. Danger? There's no danger. Men! 
1240,BRIAN, Yes. 
1241,OTTO," Oh, yes! We are a thoroughly trained suicide squad. "
1242,BRIAN, Oh. 
1243,OTTO," Oh, yes! We can commit suicide within twenty seconds.
        "
1244,BRIAN, Twenty seconds? 
1245,OTTO, You don't believe me? 
1246,BRIAN, Yes. 
1247,OTTO, I think you question me. 
1248,BRIAN," No, no, no. "
1249,OTTO, I can see you do not believe me. 
1250,BRIAN," No, no. I do. "
1251,OTTO, Enough! I'll prove it to you. Squad! 
1252,JUDEAN PEOPLE'S FRONT," Hail, Leader! "
1253,OTTO, Commit... suicide! 
1254,CAPTAIN," Two. Three. One! Two. Three. One! Two. Three. One! 
        Two. Three. One! "
1255,J.P.F., 
1256,OTTO, See? 
1257,BRIAN, Yes. 
1258,OTTO, I think now you'll believe me. Yes? 
1259,BRIAN, Yes. Very impressive. 
1260,OTTO," I think now I prove it to you, huh? "
1261,BRIAN, Yes. 
1262,OTTO, All dead. 
1263,BRIAN, Ye-- 
1264,OTTO," Not one living. He's dead... and he's dead. See? I tread 
        on him. He's dead... and he's dead... and he's dead. They're all dead. 
        All dead good Jewish boys. No foreigners! But their names will live 
        forever! Helmut, Johnny,... the little guy,... the-- er-- the other fat 
        one. Their names will live eventually forever. "
1265,RANDOM, 
1266,RANDOM, 
1267,OTTO, Wait a minute. 
1268,RANDOM, Oow! 
1269,RANDOM, A-ha. 
1270,OTTO, Who said 'ow'?! 
1271,RANDOM, Uhhlm. 
1272,OTTO," You're not dead either. Neither are you! Stand up! Stand 
        up. You're not dead. Ah-- Eh-- Oh, my heck! Stand up! Stand up, all of 
        you! Oh, my heck, is there not even one dead?! "
1273,HELMUT," No, sir. Not one. "
1274,OTTO, Why not?! 
1275,HELMUT," We thought it was a practice, sir. "
1276,OTTO, But all the bleeding and the groaning? 
1277,HELMUT," Little secreted sheeps' bladders, sir. "
1278,OTTO," Oh-- Oh, my cock! Sheeps' bladders?! "
1279,HELMUT, Yes. 
1280,OTTO," You are sour! A non-Semitic, mutinous, racially impure, 
        cloth-eared bunch of Roman-lovers! "
1281,HELMUT," Stumm, stumm, stumm. Sorry, sir. "
1282,OTTO," Tomorrow, as a punishment, you will all eat... pork 
        sausages! "
1283,J.P.F., 
1284,HELMUT," Oh, no. "
1285,OTTO," Now-- All right. Tell ze Leader that we are ready to die 
        for him ze moment he gives the sign. "
1286,BRIAN, What sign? 
1287,OTTO," The sign that is the sign. That shall be the sign. Men! 
        Forward! "
1288,J.P.F., 
1289,BRIAN, Silly bugger. 
1290,REG," Um, women taken in sin, line up against that wall, will 
        you? "
1291,JUDITH," Brian? Brian, you were fantastic! "
1292,BRIAN, You weren't so bad yourself. 
1293,JUDITH," No, what you said just now-- it was quite 
        extraordinary. "
1294,BRIAN," What? Oh, that. Was it? "
1295,JUDITH," We don't need any leaders. You're so right. Reg has 
        been dominating us for too long. "
1296,BRIAN," Well, yes. "
1297,JUDITH," It needed saying, and you said it, Brian. "
1298,BRIAN, You're... very attractive. 
1299,JUDITH, It's our revolution! We can all do it together! 
1300,BRIAN, I think-- I think-- 
1301,JUDITH," We're all behind you, Brian. The revolution is in your 
        hands! "
1302,BRIAN, What? No! That's not what I meant at all! 
1303,CENTURION," You're fuckin' nicked, me old beauty. Right. "
1304,BRIAN, Aah. 
1305,PILATE," Well, Bwian, you've given us a good wun for our money.
        "
1306,BRIAN, A what? 
1307,PILATE," This time, I guawantee you will not escape. Guard, do 
        we have any cwucifixions today? "
1308,GUARD #1," A hundred and thirty-nine, sir. Special celebration. 
        Passover, sir. "
1309,PILATE," Wight! Now we have a hundwed and forty. Nice wound 
        number, eh, Biggus? "
1310,BIGGUS DICKUS, Hm hm hm hm hm. 
1311,CENTURION, Hail Caesar! 
1312,PILATE, Hail. 
1313,CENTURION," The crowd outside is getting a bit restless, sir. 
        Permission to disperse them, please. "
1314,PILATE, Disperse them? But I haven't addwessed them yet. 
1315,CENTURION," Ah, no. I know sir, but-- "
1316,PILATE," My addwess is one of the high points of the Passover. 
        My fwiend, Biggus Dickus, has come all the way fwom Wome just to hear 
        it. "
1317,CENTURION, Hail Caesar. 
1318,BIGGUS, Hail Thaethar! 
1319,CENTURION," You're not-- ah, you're not, uh, thinking o-- of 
        giving it a miss this year, then, sir? "
1320,PILATE, Give it a miss? 
1321,CENTURION," Well, it's just that they're in a rather funny mood 
        today, sir. "
1322,PILATE," Weally, Centuwion? I'm surpwised to hear a man like 
        you wattled by a wabble of wowdy webels. "
1323,CENTURION," A... bit thundery, sir. "
1324,PILATE, Take him away. 
1325,BRIAN," I'm a Roman! I-- I can prove it, honestly! "
1326,PILATE, And cwucify him well! Biggus. 
1327,CENTURION," Ah, I-- I really wouldn't, sir. "
1328,PILATE," Out of the way, Centuwion. "
1329,BIGGUS," Let me come with you, Pontiuth. I may be of thome 
        athithtanth if there ith a thudden crithith. "
1330,REG," Right. Now, uh, item four: attainment of world supremacy 
        within the next five years. Uh, Francis, you've been doing some work on 
        this. "
1331,FRANCIS," Yeah. Thank you, Reg. Well, quite frankly, siblings, 
        I think five years is optimistic, unless we can smash the Roman empire 
        within the next twelve months. "
1332,REG, Twelve months? 
1333,FRANCIS," Yeah, twelve months. And, let's face it. As empires 
        go, this is the big one, so we've got to get up off our arses and stop 
        just talking about it! "
1334,COMMANDOS, Hear! Hear! 
1335,LORETTA," I agree. It's action that counts, not words, and we 
        need action now. "
1336,COMMANDOS, Hear! Hear! 
1337,REG," You're right. We could sit around here all day talking, 
        passing resolutions, making clever speeches. It's not going to shift one 
        Roman soldier! "
1338,FRANCIS," So, let's just stop gabbing on about it. It's 
        completely pointless and it's getting us nowhere! "
1339,COMMANDOS, Right! 
1340,LORETTA, I agree. This is a complete waste of time. 
1341,JUDITH, They've arrested Brian! 
1342,REG, What? 
1343,COMMANDOS, What? 
1344,JUDITH," They've dragged him off! They're going to crucify him!
        "
1345,REG, Right! This calls for immediate discussion! 
1346,COMMANDO #1, Yeah. 
1347,JUDITH, What?! 
1348,COMMANDO #2, Immediate. 
1349,COMMANDO #1, Right. 
1350,LORETTA, New motion? 
1351,REG," Completely new motion, eh, that, ah-- that there be, ah, 
        immediate action-- "
1352,FRANCIS," Ah, once the vote has been taken. "
1353,REG," Well, obviously once the vote's been taken. You can't act 
        another resolution till you've voted on it... "
1354,JUDITH," Reg, for God's sake, let's go now! "
1355,REG, Yeah. Yeah. 
1356,JUDITH, Please! 
1357,REG, Right. Right. 
1358,FRANCIS, Fine. 
1359,REG," In the-- in the light of fresh information from, ahh, 
        sibling Judith-- "
1360,LORETTA," Ah, not so fast, Reg. "
1361,JUDITH," Reg, for God's sake, it's perfectly simple. All you've 
        got to do is to go out of that door now, and try to stop the Romans' 
        nailing him up! It's happening, Reg! Something's actually happening, 
        Reg! Can't you understand?! Ohhh! "
1362,REG, Hm. Hm. 
1363,FRANCIS," Oh, dear. "
1364,REG, Hello. Another little ego trip for the feminists. 
1365,LORETTA, What? 
1366,FRANCIS, 
1367,REG," Oh, sorry, Loretta. Ahh, oh, read that back, would you?
        "

1377,NISUS," Oh. Oh, well, that's jolly good. Well, off you go, 
        then. "

1535,MR. CHEEKY," Oh, dear. You mean I might have to give up being 
        crucified in the afternoons? "
1536,PARVUS, Shut up! 
1537,MR. CHEEKY," That would be a blow. Wouldn't it? I wouldn't have 
        nothing to do. Ohh, thank you. "

1552,JAILER," Well, I knew she never really liked him, so I kiss--
        "
1553,REG," Right. That's the motion to get on with it, passed with, 
        uh, one abstention. I now propose that we go without further ado. May I 
        have a seconder for... "
1554,FRANCIS, Let's just go. 
1555,REG," Yeah, all right. "
1556,MAN," Oh, no. "
1557,BEGGAR, Oof. Bloody Romans! 
1558,CENTURION, Watch it! There's still a few crosses left. 
1559,PARVUS," Up you go, Big Nose! "
1560,MR. BIG NOSE," I'll get you for this, you bastard. "
1561,PARVUS," Oh, yeah? "
1562,MR. BIG NOSE," Oh, yeah. Don't worry. I never forget a face.
        "
1563,PARVUS, No? 
1564,MR. BIG NOSE," I warned you. I'm going to punch you so hard, 
        you Roman git! "
1565,PARVUS," Shut up, you Jewish turd! "
1566,MR. BIG NOSE," Who are you calling Jewish?! I'm not Jewish! I'm 
        a Samaritan! "
1567,GREGORY," A Samaritan? This is supposed to be a Jewish section.
        "
1568,PARVUS," It doesn't matter! You're all going to die in a day or 
        two. "
1569,GREGORY," It may not matter to you, Roman, but it certainly 
        matters to us. Doesn't it, darling? "
1570,MRS. GREGORY," Oh, rather. "
1571,GREGORY," Under the terms of the Roman occupancy, we're 
        entitled to be crucified in a purely Jewish area. "
1572,PHARISEE, Pharisees separate from Sadducees. 
1573,WELSH MAN, And Swedish separate from Welsh. 
1574,VICTIMS, Yeah... 
1575,PARVUS," All right! All right! All right! We'll soon settle 
        this! Hands up, all those who don't want to be crucified here. "
1576,VICTIMS, Ooh. Oh. Uh. Uh... 
1577,PARVUS, Right. Next! 
1578,SAINTLY PASSER-BY," Ah, look. It's not my cross. "
1579,PARVUS, What?! 
1580,SAINTLY PASSER-BY," Um, it's not my cross. I was, ah, holding 
        it for someone. Um-- "
1581,PARVUS, Just lie down. I haven't got all day. 
1582,SAINTLY PASSER-BY," No, of course. Um, look. I hate to make a 
        fuss-- "
1583,PARVUS, Look. 
1584,SAINTLY PASSER-BY, Uhh-- 
1585,PARVUS," We've had a busy day. There's a hundred and forty of 
        you lot to get up. "
1586,GREGORY, Is he Jewish? 
1587,PARVUS, Will you be quiet?! 
1588,GREGORY, We don't want any more Samaritans around here. 
1589,PARVUS, Belt up! 
1590,SAINTLY PASSER-BY," Uh, will you let me down if he comes back?
        "
1591,PARVUS," Yeah. Yeah, we'll let you down. Next! "
1592,BRIAN," You don't have to do this. You don't have to take 
        orders. "
1593,PARVUS, I like orders. 
1594,MR. CHEEKY," See? Not so bad, once you're up. You being 
        rescued, then? Are you? "
1595,BRIAN," It's a bit late for that now, isn't it? "
1596,MR. CHEEKY," Oh, now, now. We've got a couple of days up here. 
        Plenty of time. Lots of people get rescued. "
1597,BRIAN, Ohh? 
1598,MR. CHEEKY," Oh, yeah. My brother usually rescues me, if he can 
        keep off the tail for more than twenty minutes. Huh. "
1599,BRIAN, Ahhh? 
1600,MR. CHEEKY," Randy little bugger. Up and down like the Assyrian 
        Empire. Heh heh heh heh. "
1601,BRIAN, Reg! 
1602,REG," Hello, sibling Brian. "
1603,BRIAN," Thank God you've come, Reg. "
1604,REG," Ahh, yes. Well, I think I should point out first, Brian, 
        in all fairness, that we are not in fact the rescue committee. However, 
        I have been asked to read the following prepared statement on behalf of 
        the Movement. Uh, 'We, the People's Front of Judea, brackets, officials, 
        end brackets, do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly 
        greetings to you, Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom.' "
1605,BRIAN, What? 
1606,REG," 'Your death will stand as a landmark in the continuing 
        struggle to liberate the parent land from the hands of the Roman 
        Imperialist aggressors, excluding those concerned with drainage, 
        medicine, roads, housing, education, viniculture, and any other Romans 
        contributing to the welfare of Jews of both sexes and hermaphrodites. 
        Signed on behalf of the P.F.J., etcetera.' And I'd just like to add, on 
        a personal note, my own admiration for what you are doing for us, Brian, 
        at what must be, after all, for you, a very difficult time. "
1607,BRIAN," Reg! Well, what are you going to do? "
1608,REG," Good-bye, Brian, and thanks. "
1609,FRANCIS," Well done, Brian. Keep it up, lad. "
1610,LORETTA," Terrific work, Brian. "
1611,P.F.J., 
1612,REG, Yeah. Right. And... 
1613,P.F.J., 
1614,LORETTA, And so say all of--

1633,CENTURION, All right. Take him away and release him. 
1634,MR. CHEEKY," No, I'm only joking. I'm not really Brian. No, I'm 
        not Brian. I was only-- It was a joke. I'm only pulling your leg! It's a 
        joke! I'm not him! I'm just having you on! Put me back! Bloody Romans! 
        Can't take a joke! "

1645,JUDITH," Terrific! Great! Reg has explained it all to me, and I 
        think it's great what you are doing. "
1646,MANDY," So, there you are! I might have known it would end up 
        like this. To think of all the love and affection I've wasted on you. 
        Well, if that's how you treat your poor old mother in the autumn years 
        of her life, all I can say is, 'Go ahead. Be crucified. See if I care.' 
        I might have known it would... "
1647,BRIAN, Mum! 
1648,MANDY," ...end up like this. Sex, sex. That's... "
1649,BRIAN, Mum! 
1650,MANDY," ...all young people are interested in nowadays. I don't 
        know what the world's coming to. "
1651,MR. FRISBEE," Cheer up, Brian. You know what they say. Some 
        things in life are bad. They can really make you mad. Other things just 
        make you swear and curse. When you're chewing on life's gristle, Don't 
        grumble. Give a whistle. And this'll help things turn out for the best. 
        And... "
1652,SEVERAL, 
1653,MR. FRISBEE, Come on! 
1654,SEVERAL," Always look on the right 
        side of life, "
1655,MR. FRISBEE," For life is quite absurd And death's the final 
        word. You must always face the curtain with a bow. Forget about your 
        sin. Give the audience a grin. 
        "
1656,EVERYONE," Enjoy it. It's your last 
        chance, anyhow. So,... "
1657,MR. FRISBEE," Life's a piece of shit, When you look at it. 
        Life's a laugh and death's a joke. It's true. You'll see it's all a 
        show. Keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is 
        on you. And... "
1658,EVERYONE, Always look on the bright side of life. 
1659,MR. FRISBEE," Come on, Brian. Cheer up. "

1676,EVERYONE, Always look on the bright side of life! 
1677,MR. FRISBEE," They'll never make their money back, you know. I told him. "
1678,EVERYONE, 
1679,MR. FRISBEE," I said to him, 'Bernie.' I said, 'They'll never make their money back.' "
