0,ARTHUR, Whoa there! 
1,SOLDIER #1, Halt! Who goes there? 
2,ARTHUR," It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from 
        the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons, 
        Sovereign of all England! "
3,SOLDIER #1, Pull the other one! 
4,ARTHUR," I am, and this is my trusty servant Patsy. We 
        have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who 
        will join me in my court at Camelot. I must speak with your lord and 
        master. "
5,SOLDIER #1, What? Ridden on a horse? 
6,ARTHUR, Yes! 
7,SOLDIER #1, You're using coconuts! 
8,ARTHUR, What? 
9,SOLDIER #1," You've got two empty halves of coconut and 
        you're bangin' 'em together. "
10,ARTHUR," So? We have ridden since the snows of winter 
        covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercia, through-- "
11,SOLDIER #1, Where'd you get the coconuts? 
12,ARTHUR, We found them. 
13,SOLDIER #1," Found them? In Mercia? The coconut's 
        tropical! "
14,ARTHUR, What do you mean? 
15,SOLDIER #1," Well, this is a temperate zone. "
16,ARTHUR," The swallow may fly south with the sun or the 
        house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these 
        are not strangers to our land? "
17,SOLDIER #1, Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? 
18,SOLDIER #1, What? A swallow carrying a coconut? 
19,SOLDIER #1," It's not a question of where he grips it! 
        It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not 
        carry a one pound coconut. "
20,ARTHUR," Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell 
        your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here? "
21,SOLDIER #1," Listen. In order to maintain air-speed 
        velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every 
        second, right? "
22,ARTHUR, Please! 
23,SOLDIER #1, Am I right? 
24,ARTHUR, I'm not interested! 
25,SOLDIER #2," It could be carried by an African swallow!
        "
26,SOLDIER #1," Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not 
        a European swallow. That's my point. "
27,SOLDIER #2," Oh, yeah, I agree with that. "
28,ARTHUR," Will you ask your master if he wants to join my 
        court at Camelot?! "
29,SOLDIER #1," But then of course, uh, African swallows are 
        non-migratory. "
30,SOLDIER #2," Oh, yeah. "
31,SOLDIER #1," So, they couldn't bring a coconut back 
        anyway. "
32,SOLDIER #2," Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows 
        carried it together? "
33,SOLDIER #1," No, they'd have to have it on a line. "
34,SOLDIER #2," Well, simple! They'd just use a strand of 
        creeper! "
35,SOLDIER #1," What, held under the dorsal guiding 
        feathers? "
36,SOLDIER #2," Well, why not? "
37,CART MASTER, Bring out your dead! 
38,CUSTOMER, Here's one. 
39,CART MASTER, Nine pence. 
40,DEAD PERSON, I'm not dead! 
41,CART MASTER, What? 
42,CUSTOMER, Nothing. Here's your nine pence. 
43,DEAD PERSON, I'm not dead! 
44,CART MASTER, 'Ere. He says he's not dead! 
45,CUSTOMER," Yes, he is. "
46,DEAD PERSON, I'm not! 
47,CART MASTER, He isn't? 
48,CUSTOMER," Well, he will be soon. He's very ill. "
49,DEAD PERSON, I'm getting better! 
50,CUSTOMER," No, you're not. You'll be stone dead in a moment.
        "
51,CART MASTER," Oh, I can't take him like that. It's against 
        regulations. "
52,DEAD PERSON, I don't want to go on the cart! 
53,CUSTOMER," Oh, don't be such a baby. "
54,CART MASTER, I can't take him. 
55,DEAD PERSON, I feel fine! 
56,CUSTOMER," Well, do us a favor. "
57,CART MASTER, I can't. 
58,CUSTOMER," Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes? He 
        won't be long. "
59,CART MASTER," No, I've got to go to the Robinsons'. They've 
        lost nine today. "
60,CUSTOMER," Well, when's your next round? "
61,CART MASTER, Thursday. 
62,DEAD PERSON, I think I'll go for a walk. 
63,CUSTOMER," You're not fooling anyone, you know. Look. Isn't 
        there something you can do? "
64,DEAD PERSON, 
65,CUSTOMER," Ah, thanks very much. "
66,CART MASTER, Not at all. See you on Thursday. 
67,CUSTOMER, Right. All right. 
68,CART MASTER, I dunno. Must be a king. 
69,CUSTOMER, Why? 
70,CART MASTER, He hasn't got shit all over him. 
71,ARTHUR, Old woman! 
72,DENNIS, Man! 
73,ARTHUR," Man. Sorry. What knight lives in that castle over 
        there? "
74,DENNIS, I'm thirty-seven. 
75,ARTHUR, I-- what? 
76,DENNIS, I'm thirty-seven. I'm not old. 
77,ARTHUR," Well, I can't just call you 'Man'. "
78,DENNIS," Well, you could say 'Dennis'. "
79,ARTHUR," Well, I didn't know you were called 'Dennis'. "
80,DENNIS," Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you? "
81,ARTHUR," I did say 'sorry' about the 'old woman', but from the 
        behind you looked-- "
82,DENNIS," What I object to is that you automatically treat me 
        like an inferior! "
83,ARTHUR," Well, I am King! "
84,DENNIS," Oh, King, eh, very nice. And how d'you get that, eh? 
        By exploiting the workers! By 'anging on to outdated imperialist dogma 
        which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society. If 
        there's ever going to be any progress with the-- "
85,WOMAN," Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here. Oh! How 
        d'you do? "
86,ARTHUR," How do you do, good lady? I am Arthur, King of the 
        Britons. Who's castle is that? "
87,WOMAN, King of the who? 
88,ARTHUR, The Britons. 
89,WOMAN, Who are the Britons? 
90,ARTHUR," Well, we all are. We are all Britons, and I am your 
        king. "
91,WOMAN," I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an 
        autonomous collective. "
92,DENNIS," You're fooling yourself. We're living in a 
        dictatorship: a self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working 
        classes-- "
93,WOMAN," Oh, there you go bringing class into it again. "
94,DENNIS," That's what it's all about. If only people would hear 
        of-- "
95,ARTHUR," Please! Please, good people. I am in haste. Who lives 
        in that castle? "
96,WOMAN, No one lives there. 
97,ARTHUR, Then who is your lord? 
98,WOMAN, We don't have a lord. 
99,ARTHUR, What? 
100,DENNIS," I told you. We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We 
        take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week,...
        "
101,ARTHUR, Yes. 
102,DENNIS," ...but all the decisions of that officer have to be 
        ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting... "
103,ARTHUR," Yes, I see. "
104,DENNIS," ...by a simple majority in the case of purely internal 
        affairs,... "
105,ARTHUR, Be quiet! 
106,DENNIS," ...but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more 
        major-- "
107,ARTHUR, Be quiet! I order you to be quiet! 
108,WOMAN," Order, eh? Who does he think he is? Heh. "
109,ARTHUR, I am your king! 
110,WOMAN," Well, I didn't vote for you. "
111,ARTHUR, You don't vote for kings. 
112,WOMAN," Well, how did you become King, then? "
113,ARTHUR," The Lady of the Lake,... "
114,DENNIS," Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing 
        swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power 
        derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic 
        ceremony. "
115,ARTHUR, Be quiet! 
116,DENNIS," Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive 
        power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! "
117,ARTHUR, Shut up! 
118,DENNIS," I mean, if I went 'round saying I was an emperor just 
        because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me 
        away! "
119,ARTHUR," Shut up, will you? Shut up! "
120,DENNIS," Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.
        "
121,ARTHUR, Shut up! 
122,DENNIS," Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! 
        Help! Help! I'm being repressed! "
123,ARTHUR, Bloody peasant! 
124,DENNIS," Oh, what a give-away. Did you hear that? Did you hear 
        that, eh? That's what I'm on about. Did you see him repressing me? You 
        saw it, didn't you? "
125,BLACK KNIGHT, Aaaagh! 
126,BLACK KNIGHT, Aaagh! 
127,GREEN KNIGHT, Ooh! 
128,BLACK KNIGHT, Aagh! 
129,GREEN KNIGHT, Oh! 
130,BLACK KNIGHT, Aaaagh! 
131,BLACK KNIGHT and GREEN KNIGHT," Agh!, oh!, etc. "
132,GREEN KNIGHT, Aaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! 
133,BLACK KNIGHT, Umm! 
134,ARTHUR," You fight with the strength of many men, Sir Knight.
        "
135,BLACK KNIGHT, None shall pass. 
136,ARTHUR, What? 
137,BLACK KNIGHT, None shall pass. 
138,ARTHUR," I have no quarrel with you, good Sir Knight, but I 
        must cross this bridge. "
139,BLACK KNIGHT, Then you shall die. 
140,ARTHUR," I command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside!
        "
141,BLACK KNIGHT, I move for no man. 
142,ARTHUR, So be it! 
143,ARTHUR and BLACK KNIGHT," Aaah!, hiyaah!, etc. "
144,ARTHUR," Now stand aside, worthy adversary. "
145,BLACK KNIGHT, 'Tis but a scratch. 
146,ARTHUR, A scratch? Your arm's off! 
147,BLACK KNIGHT," No, it isn't. "
148,ARTHUR," Well, what's that, then? "
149,BLACK KNIGHT, I've had worse. 
150,ARTHUR, You liar! 
151,BLACK KNIGHT," Come on, you pansy! "
152,ARTHUR, Victory is mine! 
153,BLACK KNIGHT, Hah! 
154,ARTHUR, What? 
155,BLACK KNIGHT, Have at you! 
156,ARTHUR," Eh. You are indeed brave, Sir Knight, but the fight is 
        mine. "
157,BLACK KNIGHT," Oh, had enough, eh? "
158,ARTHUR," Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left. "
159,BLACK KNIGHT," Yes, I have. "
160,ARTHUR, Look! 
161,BLACK KNIGHT, Just a flesh wound. 
162,ARTHUR," Look, stop that. "
163,BLACK KNIGHT, Chicken! 
164,ARTHUR," Look, I'll have your leg. "
165,BLACK KNIGHT, Right. I'll do you for that! 
166,ARTHUR, You'll what? 
167,BLACK KNIGHT, Come here! 
168,ARTHUR," What are you going to do, bleed on me? "
169,BLACK KNIGHT, I'm invincible! 
170,ARTHUR, You're a looney. 
171,BLACK KNIGHT," The Black Knight always triumphs! Have at you! 
        Come on, then. "
172,BLACK KNIGHT," Oh? All right, we'll call it a draw. "
173,ARTHUR," Come, Patsy. "
174,BLACK KNIGHT," Oh. Oh, I see. Running away, eh? You yellow 
        bastards! Come back here and take what's coming to you. I'll bite your 
        legs off! "
175,MONKS,
176,CROWD, A witch! A witch! 
177,MONKS, 
178,CROWD," A witch! A witch! A witch! A witch! We've found a 
        witch! A witch! A witch! A witch! A witch! We've got a witch! A witch! A 
        witch! Burn her! Burn her! Burn her! We've found a witch! We've found a 
        witch! A witch! A witch! A witch! "
179,VILLAGER #1, We have found a witch. May we burn her? 
180,CROWD, Burn her! Burn! Burn her! Burn her! 
181,BEDEVERE, How do you know she is a witch? 
182,VILLAGER #2, She looks like one. 
183,CROWD, Right! Yeah! Yeah! 
184,BEDEVERE, Bring her forward. 
185,WITCH, I'm not a witch. I'm not a witch. 
186,BEDEVERE," Uh, but you are dressed as one. "
187,WITCH, They dressed me up like this. 
188,CROWD," Augh, we didn't! We didn't... "
189,WITCH, And this isn't my nose. It's a false one. 
190,BEDEVERE, Well? 
191,VILLAGER #1," Well, we did do the nose. "
192,BEDEVERE, The nose? 
193,VILLAGER #1," And the hat, but she is a witch! "
194,VILLAGER #2, Yeah! 
195,CROWD, We burn her! Right! Yeaaah! Yeaah! 
196,BEDEVERE, Did you dress her up like this? 
197,VILLAGER #1, No! 
198,VILLAGER #2 and 3, No. No. 
199,VILLAGER #2, No. 
200,VILLAGER #1, No. 
201,VILLAGERS #2 and #3, No. 
202,VILLAGER #1, Yes. 
203,VILLAGER #2, Yes. 
204,VILLAGER #1," Yes. Yeah, a bit. "
205,VILLAGER #3, A bit. 
206,VILLAGERS #1 and #2, A bit. 
207,VILLAGER #3, A bit. 
208,VILLAGER #1, She has got a wart. 
209,RANDOM, 
210,BEDEVERE, What makes you think she is a witch? 
211,VILLAGER #3," Well, she turned me into a newt. "
212,BEDEVERE, A newt? 
213,VILLAGER #3, I got better. 
214,VILLAGER #2, Burn her anyway! 
215,VILLAGER #1, Burn! 
216,CROWD, Burn her! Burn! Burn her!... 
217,BEDEVERE," Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of 
        telling whether she is a witch. "
218,VILLAGER #1, Are there? 
219,VILLAGER #2, Ah? 
220,VILLAGER #1, What are they? 
221,CROWD, Tell us! Tell us!... 
222,VILLAGER #2, Do they hurt? 
223,BEDEVERE, Tell me. What do you do with witches? 
224,VILLAGER #2, Burn! 
225,VILLAGER #1, Burn! 
226,CROWD, Burn! Burn them up! Burn!... 
227,BEDEVERE, And what do you burn apart from witches? 
228,VILLAGER #1, More witches! 
229,VILLAGER #3, Shh! 
230,VILLAGER #2, Wood! 
231,BEDEVERE," So, why do witches burn? "
232,VILLAGER #3, B--... 'cause they're made of... wood? 
233,BEDEVERE, Good! Heh heh. 
234,CROWD," Oh, yeah. Oh. "
235,BEDEVERE," So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood? "
236,VILLAGER #1, Build a bridge out of her. 
237,BEDEVERE," Ah, but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
        "
238,VILLAGER #1," Oh, yeah. "
239,RANDOM," Oh, yeah. True. Uhh... "
240,BEDEVERE, Does wood sink in water? 
241,VILLAGER #1, No. No. 
242,VILLAGER #2," No, it floats! It floats! "
243,VILLAGER #1, Throw her into the pond! 
244,CROWD, The pond! Throw her into the pond! 
245,BEDEVERE, What also floats in water? 
246,VILLAGER #1, Bread! 
247,VILLAGER #2, Apples! 
248,VILLAGER #3," Uh, very small rocks! "
249,VILLAGER #1, Cider! 
250,VILLAGER #2," Uh, gra-- gravy! "
251,VILLAGER #1, Cherries! 
252,VILLAGER #2, Mud! 
253,VILLAGER #3," Uh, churches! Churches! "
254,VILLAGER #2, Lead! Lead! 
255,ARTHUR, A duck! 
256,CROWD, Oooh. 
257,BEDEVERE," Exactly. So, logically... "
258,VILLAGER #1," If... she... weighs... the same as a duck,... 
        she's made of wood. "
259,BEDEVERE, And therefore? 
260,VILLAGER #2, A witch! 
261,VILLAGER #1, A witch! 
262,CROWD, A witch! A witch!... 
263,VILLAGER #4, Here is a duck. Use this duck. 
264,BEDEVERE, Very good. We shall use my largest scales. 
265,CROWD," Ohh! Ohh! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn her! 
        Burn her! Burn her! Burn her! Burn her! Burn her! Burn her! Ahh! Ahh...
        "
266,BEDEVERE, Right. Remove the supports! 
267,CROWD, A witch! A witch! A witch! 
268,WITCH, It's a fair cop. 
269,VILLAGER #3, Burn her! 
270,CROWD, Burn her! Burn her! Burn her! Burn! Burn!... 
271,BEDEVERE," Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
        "
272,ARTHUR," I am Arthur, King of the Britons. "
273,BEDEVERE, My liege! 
274,ARTHUR," Good Sir Knight, will you come with me to Camelot and 
        join us at the Round Table? "
275,BEDEVERE, My liege! I would be honored. 
276,ARTHUR, What is your name? 
277,BEDEVERE," 'Bedevere', my liege. "
278,ARTHUR," Then I dub you 'Sir Bedemere, Knight of the Round 
        Table'. "
279,NARRATOR," The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King 
        Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir 
        Lancelot the Brave, Sir Gallahad the Pure, and Sir Robin 
        the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon 
        of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, 
        and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill, and the 
        aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film. Together they formed a band 
        whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: The 
        Knights of the Round Table. "
280,SIR BEDEVERE," And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to 
        be banana-shaped. "
281,ARTHUR," This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain 
        again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes. "
282,BEDEVERE," Oh, certainly, sir. "
283,SIR LANCELOT," Look, my liege! "
284,ARTHUR, Camelot! 
285,SIR GALAHAD, Camelot! 
286,LANCELOT, Camelot! 
287,PATSY, It's only a model. 
288,ARTHUR," Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let 
        us ride... to... Camelot! "
289,KNIGHTS, 
290,PRISONER, 
291,KNIGHTS, 
292,MAN, I have to push the pram a lot. 
293,ARTHUR," Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It 
        is a silly place. "
294,KNIGHTS, Right. Right. 
295,GOD," Arthur! Arthur, King of the Britons! Oh, don't grovel!
        "
296,ARTHUR, Sorry. 
297,GOD," And don't apologize. Every time I try to talk to someone 
        it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'. "
298,ARTHUR," I'm averting my eyes, O Lord. "
299,GOD," Well, don't. It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're 
        so depressing. Now, knock it off! "
300,ARTHUR," Yes, Lord. "
301,GOD," Right! Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the 
        Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark 
        times. "
302,ARTHUR," Good idea, O Lord! "
303,GOD, 'Course it's a good idea! Behold! 
304,LANCELOT, A blessing! A blessing from the Lord! 
305,GALAHAD, God be praised! 
306,ARTHUR, Halt!
307,FRENCH GUARD, Allo! Who is eet? 
308,ARTHUR," It is King Arthur, and these are my Knights of the 
        Round Table. Whose castle is this? "
309,FRENCH GUARD," This is the castle of my master, Guy de 
        Loimbard. "
310,ARTHUR," Go and tell your master that we have been charged by 
        God with a sacred quest. If he will give us food and shelter for the 
        night, he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail. "
311,FRENCH GUARD," Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be 
        very keen. Uh, he's already got one, you see. "
312,ARTHUR, What? 
313,GALAHAD, He says they've already got one! 
314,ARTHUR, Are you sure he's got one? 
315,FRENCH GUARD," Oh, yes. It's very nice-a. (I told him we 
        already got one.) "
316,FRENCH GUARDS, 
317,ARTHUR," Well, u-- um, can we come up and have a look? "
318,FRENCH GUARD, Of course not! You are English types-a! 
319,ARTHUR," Well, what are you, then? "
320,FRENCH GUARD," I'm French! Why do think I have this outrageous 
        accent, you silly king-a?! "
321,GALAHAD, What are you doing in England? 
322,FRENCH GUARD, Mind your own business! 
323,ARTHUR," If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your 
        castle by force! "
324,FRENCH GUARD," You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and 
        boil your bottom, sons of a silly person. I blow my nose at you, 
        so-called Arthur King, you and all your silly English k-nnnnniggets. 
        Thpppppt! Thppt! Thppt! "
325,GALAHAD, What a strange person. 
326,ARTHUR," Now look here, my good man-- "
327,FRENCH GUARD," I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty 
        headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your 
        mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! "
328,GALAHAD, Is there someone else up there we could talk to? 
329,FRENCH GUARD," No. Now, go away, or I shall taunt you a second 
        time-a!"
330,ARTHUR," Now, this is your last chance. I've been more than 
        reasonable. "
331,FRENCH GUARD, (Fetchez la vache.) 
332,OTHER FRENCH GUARD, Quoi? 
333,FRENCH GUARD, (Fetchez la vache!)
334,ARTHUR," If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall--"
335,KNIGHTS, Christ!
336,ARTHUR, Right! Charge! 
337,KNIGHTS, Charge!
338,FRENCH GUARD," Hey, this one is for your mother! There you go.
        "
339,FRENCH GUARD, And this one's for your dad! 
340,ARTHUR, Run away! 
341,KNIGHTS, Run away! 
342,FRENCH GUARD, Thppppt! 
343,FRENCH GUARDS, 
344,LANCELOT, Fiends! I'll tear them apart! 
345,ARTHUR," No, no. No, no. "
346,BEDEVERE," Sir! I have a plan, sir. "
347,FRENCH GUARDS, 
348,ARTHUR, What happens now? 
349,BEDEVERE," Well, now, uh, Lancelot, Galahad, and I, uh, wait 
        until nightfall, and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French, uh, 
        by surprise. Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed! "
350,ARTHUR, Who leaps out? 
351,BEDEVERE," U-- u-- uh, Lancelot, Galahad, and I, uh, leap out 
        of the rabbit, uh, and uh... "
352,ARTHUR, Ohh. 
353,BEDEVERE," Oh. Um, l-- look, i-- i-- if we built this large 
        wooden badger--"
354,ARTHUR, Run away! 
355,KNIGHTS," Run away! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run away! Run 
        away! Run away!"
356,FRENCH GUARDS," Oh, haw haw haw haw! Haw! Haw haw heh...

357,NARRATOR," The Tale of Sir Robin. So, each of the knights went 
        their separate ways. Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of 
        Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels. "
358,MINSTREL, 
359,SIR ROBIN," That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, 
        lads. Heh. Looks like there's dirty work afoot. "
360,DENNIS," Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
        "
361,WOMAN," Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom. We haven't got enough 
        mud. "
362,ALL HEADS (THREE-HEADED KNIGHT), Halt! 
363,MINSTREL, 
364,ROBIN," Shut up! Um, n-- n-- n-- nobody, really. I'm 
        j-- j-- j-- ju-- just, um-- just passing through. "
365,ALL HEADS, What do you want? 
366,MINSTREL, 
367,ROBIN," Shut up! Um, oo, a-- nothing. Nothing, really. I, uh-- 
        j-- j-- just-- just to, um-- just to p-- pass through, good Sir Knight.
        "
368,ALL HEADS, I'm afraid not! 
369,ROBIN," Ah. W-- well, actually I-- I am a Knight of the Round 
        Table. "
370,ALL HEADS, You're a Knight of the Round Table? 
371,ROBIN, I am. 
372,LEFT HEAD," In that case, I shall have to kill you. "
373,MIDDLE HEAD, Shall I? 
374,RIGHT HEAD," Oh, I don't think so. "
375,MIDDLE HEAD," Well, what do I think? "
376,LEFT HEAD, I think kill him. 
377,RIGHT HEAD," Oh, let's be nice to him. "
378,LEFT HEAD," Oh, shut up. "
379,ROBIN, Perhaps I could-- 
380,LEFT HEAD," And you. Oh, quick! Get the sword out. I want to 
        cut his head off! "
381,RIGHT HEAD," Oh, cut your own head off! "
382,MIDDLE HEAD," Yes, do us all a favor! "
383,LEFT HEAD, What? 
384,RIGHT HEAD, Yapping on all the time. 
385,MIDDLE HEAD, You're lucky. You're not next to him. 
386,LEFT HEAD, What do you mean? 
387,MIDDLE HEAD, You snore! 
388,LEFT HEAD," Oh, I don't. Anyway, you've got bad breath. "
389,MIDDLE HEAD," Well, it's only because you don't brush my teeth.
        "
390,RIGHT HEAD," Oh, stop bitching and let's go have tea. "
391,LEFT HEAD," Oh, all right. All right. All right. We'll kill him 
        first and then have tea and biscuits. "
392,MIDDLE HEAD, Yes. 
393,RIGHT HEAD," Oh, not biscuits. "
394,LEFT HEAD," All right. All right, not biscuits, but let's kill 
        him anyway. "
395,ALL HEADS, Right! 
396,MIDDLE HEAD, He buggered off. 
397,RIGHT HEAD, So he has. He's scarpered. 
398,MINSTREL, 
399,ROBIN, No! 
400,MINSTREL, 
401,ROBIN, I didn't!

423,GIRLS, Hello! 
424,ZOOT," Welcome, gentle Sir Knight. Welcome to the Castle 
        Anthrax. "
425,GALAHAD, The Castle Anthrax? 
426,ZOOT," Yes. Oh, it's not a very good name, is it? Oh, but we 
        are nice and we will attend to your every, every need! "
427,GALAHAD, You are the keepers of the Holy Grail? 
428,ZOOT, The what? 
429,GALAHAD, The Grail. It is here. 
430,ZOOT," Oh, but you are tired and you must rest awhile. Midget! 
        Crapper! "
431,MIDGET and CRAPPER," Yes, O Zoot? "
432,ZOOT, Prepare a bed for our guest. 
433,MIDGET and CRAPPER," Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank 
        you! Thank you! Thank you!... "
434,ZOOT," Away! Away, varletesses. The beds here are warm and soft 
        and very, very big. "
435,GALAHAD," Well, look, I-- I, uh-- "
436,ZOOT," What is your name, handsome knight? "
437,GALAHAD, 'Sir Galahad... the Chaste'. 
438,ZOOT," Mine is 'Zoot'. Just 'Zoot'. Oh, but come. "
439,GALAHAD," Look, please! In God's name, show me the Grail! "
440,ZOOT," Oh, you have suffered much. You are delirious. "
441,GALAHAD," No, look. I have seen it! It is here in this-- "
442,ZOOT," Sir Galahad! You would not be so ungallant as to refuse 
        our hospitality. "
443,GALAHAD," Well, I-- I, uh-- "
444,ZOOT," Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet 
        compared to yours. We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, 
        all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with 
        no one to protect us. Oooh. It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, 
        undressing, knitting exciting underwear. We are just not used to 
        handsome knights. Nay. Nay. Come. Come. You may lie here. Oh, but you 
        are wounded! "
445,GALAHAD," No, no. It's-- it's nothing. "
446,ZOOT," Oh, you must see the doctors immediately! No, no, 
        please! Lie down. "
447,PIGLET," Well, what seems to be the trouble? "
448,GALAHAD, They're doctors?! 
449,ZOOT," Uh, they... have a basic medical training, yes. "
450,GALAHAD, B-- but-- 
451,ZOOT," Oh, come. Come. You must try to rest. Doctor Piglet! 
        Doctor Winston! Practise your art. "
452,WINSTON, Try to relax. 
453,GALAHAD, Are you sure that's absolutely necessary? 
454,PIGLET, We must examine you. 
455,GALAHAD, There's nothing wrong with that! 
456,PIGLET, Please. We are doctors. 
457,GALAHAD, Look! This cannot be. I am sworn to chastity. 
458,PIGLET, Back to your bed! At once! 
459,GALAHAD, Torment me no longer. I have seen the Grail! 
460,PIGLET, There's no grail here. 
461,GALAHAD, I have seen it! I have seen it! 
462,GIRLS, Hello. 
463,GALAHAD, Oh. 
464,GIRLS," Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. 
        Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. 
        Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. "
465,GALAHAD, Zoot! 
466,DINGO," No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo. "
467,GALAHAD," Oh, well, excuse me, I-- "
468,DINGO, Where are you going? 
469,GALAHAD," I seek the Grail! I have seen it, here in this 
        castle! "
470,DINGO," Oh, no. Oh, no! Bad, bad Zoot! "
471,GALAHAD," Well, what is it? "
472,DINGO," Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot! She has been setting 
        alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped. 
        It's not the first time we've had this problem. "
473,GALAHAD, It's not the real Grail? 
474,DINGO," Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot! She is a bad 
        person and must pay the penalty! Do you think this scene should have 
        been cut? We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, 
        we're glad. It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think. "
475,LEFT HEAD, At least ours was better visually. 
476,DENNIS," Well, at least ours was committed. It wasn't just a 
        string of pussy jokes. "
477,OLD MAN, Get on with it. 
478,TIM THE ENCHANTER," Yes, get on with it! "
479,ARMY OF KNIGHTS," Yes, get on with it! "
480,DINGO," Oh, I am enjoying this scene. "
481,GOD, Get on with it! 
482,DINGO,
483,GIRLS, A spanking! A spanking! 
484,DINGO," You must spank her well, and after you have spanked 
        her, you may deal with her as you like, and then, spank me. "
485,AMAZING, And spank me. 
486,STUNNER, And me. 
487,LOVELY, And me. 
488,DINGO," Yes. Yes, you must give us all a good spanking! "
489,GIRLS," A spanking! A spanking! There is going to be a spanking 
        tonight! "
490,DINGO," And after the spanking, the oral sex. "
491,GIRLS, The oral sex! The oral sex! 
492,GALAHAD," Well, I could stay a bit longer. "
493,LANCELOT, Sir Galahad! 
494,GALAHAD," Oh, hello. "
495,LANCELOT, Quick! 
496,GALAHAD, What? 
497,LANCELOT, Quick! 
498,GALAHAD, Why? 
499,LANCELOT, You are in great peril! 
500,DINGO," No, he isn't. "
501,LANCELOT," Silence, foul temptress! "
502,GALAHAD," You know, she's got a point. "
503,LANCELOT, Come on! We will cover your escape! 
504,GALAHAD," Look, I'm fine! "
505,LANCELOT, Come on! 
506,GIRLS, Sir Galahad! 
507,GALAHAD," No. Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed! "
508,DINGO, Yes! Let him tackle us single-handed! 
509,GIRLS, Yes! Let him tackle us single-handed! 
510,LANCELOT," No, Sir Galahad. Come on! "
511,GALAHAD," No! Really! Honestly, I can cope. I can handle this 
        lot easily. "
512,DINGO," Oh, yes. Let him handle us easily. "
513,GIRLS, Yes. Let him handle us easily. 
514,LANCELOT, No. Quick! Quick! 
515,GALAHAD," Please! I can defeat them! There's only a 
        hundred-and-fifty of them! "
516,DINGO," Yes! Yes, he will beat us easily! We haven't a chance.
        "
517,GIRLS, We haven't a chance. He will beat us easily...
518,DINGO," Oh, shit. "
519,LANCELOT," We were in the nick of time. You were in great 
        peril. "
520,GALAHAD, I don't think I was. 
521,LANCELOT," Yes, you were. You were in terrible peril. "
522,GALAHAD," Look, let me go back in there and face the peril. "
523,LANCELOT," No, it's too perilous. "
524,GALAHAD," Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much 
        peril as I can. "
525,LANCELOT," No, we've got to find the Holy Grail. Come on! "
526,GALAHAD," Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril? "
527,LANCELOT, No. It's unhealthy. 
528,GALAHAD, I bet you're gay. 
529,LANCELOT," No, I'm not. "
530,NARRATOR," Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost 
        certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail. Meanwhile, 
        King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had 
        discovered something. Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously. 
        I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away-- four, 
        really, if they had a coconut on a line between them. I mean, if the 
        birds were walking and dragging-- "
531,CROWD, Get on with it! 
532,NARRATOR," Oh, anyway. On to scene twenty-four, which is a 
        smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a 
        vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you 
        can hear a starling-- oooh! "
533,OLD MAN," Heh, hee ha ha 
        hee hee! Hee hee hee ha ha ha... "
534,ARTHUR," And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the 
        Grail? "
535,OLD MAN," ...Ha ha ha ha! Heh, hee ha ha hee! Ha hee ha! Ha ha 
        ha ha... "
536,ARTHUR, Where does he live? 
537,OLD MAN, ...Heh heh heh heh... 
538,ARTHUR," Old man, where does he live? "
539,OLD MAN," ...Hee ha ha ha. He knows of a cave, a cave which no 
        man has entered. "
540,ARTHUR, And the Grail. The Grail is there? 
541,OLD MAN," There is much danger, for beyond the cave lies the 
        Gorge of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed. "
542,ARTHUR, But the Grail! Where is the Grail?! 
543,OLD MAN, Seek you the Bridge of Death. 
544,ARTHUR," The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail? "
545,OLD MAN," Heh, hee hee hee hee! Ha ha ha ha ha! Hee ha ha...

546,HEAD KNIGHT OF NI, Ni! 
547,KNIGHTS OF NI, Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! 
548,ARTHUR, Who are you? 
549,HEAD KNIGHT, We are the Knights Who Say... 'Ni'! 
550,RANDOM, Ni! 
551,ARTHUR, No! Not the Knights Who Say 'Ni'! 
552,HEAD KNIGHT, The same! 
553,BEDEVERE, Who are they? 
554,HEAD KNIGHT," We are the keepers of the sacred words: 'Ni', 
        'Peng', and 'Neee-wom'! "
555,RANDOM, Neee-wom! 
556,ARTHUR, Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale. 
557,HEAD KNIGHT, The Knights Who Say 'Ni' demand a sacrifice. 
558,ARTHUR," Knights of Ni, we are but simple travellers who seek 
        the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. "
559,HEAD KNIGHT, Ni! 
560,KNIGHTS OF NI, Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!... 
561,ARTHUR, Ow! Ow! Ow! Agh! 
562,HEAD KNIGHT," We shall say 'ni' again to you if you do not 
        appease us. "
563,ARTHUR," Well, what is it you want? "
564,HEAD KNIGHT, We want... a shrubbery! 
565,ARTHUR, A what? 
566,KNIGHTS OF NI, Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! 
567,ARTHUR and PARTY, Ow! Oh! 
568,ARTHUR," Please! Please! No more! We will find you a shrubbery.
        "
569,HEAD KNIGHT," You must return here with a shrubbery, or else, 
        you will never pass through this wood... alive. "
570,ARTHUR," O Knights of Ni, you are just and fair, and we will 
        return with a shrubbery. "
571,HEAD KNIGHT, One that looks nice. 
572,ARTHUR, Of course. 
573,HEAD KNIGHT, And not too expensive. 
574,ARTHUR, Yes. 
575,HEAD KNIGHT, Now... go!

583,NARRATOR," The Tale of 
        Sir Lancelot. "
584,FATHER," One day, lad, all this will be yours! "
585,PRINCE HERBERT," What, the curtains? "
586,FATHER," No. Not the curtains, lad. All that you can see, 
        stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land! This'll be your 
        kingdom, lad. "
587,HERBERT, But Mother-- 
588,FATHER," Father, lad. Father. "
589,HERBERT," B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that. "
590,FATHER," Listen, lad. I built this kingdom up from nothing. 
        When I started here, all there was was swamp. Other kings said I was 
        daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to 
        show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one. That sank 
        into the swamp. So, I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, 
        then sank into the swamp, but the fourth one... stayed up! And that's 
        what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands. "
591,HERBERT, But I don't want any of that. I'd rather-- 
592,FATHER, Rather what?! 
593,HERBERT, I'd rather... 
594,FATHER," Stop that! Stop that! You're not going into a song 
        while I'm here. Now listen, lad. In twenty minutes, you're getting 
        married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in 
        Britain. "
595,HERBERT, B-- but I don't want land. 
596,FATHER," Listen, Alice,-- "
597,HERBERT, Herbert. 
598,FATHER," 'Erbert. We live in a bloody swamp. We need all the 
        land we can get. "
599,HERBERT, But-- but I don't like her. 
600,FATHER," Don't like her?! What's wrong with her?! She's 
        beautiful. She's rich. She's got huge... tracts o' land! "
601,HERBERT," I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to 
        have... "
602,FATHER," Cut that out! Cut that out! Look, you're marrying 
        Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea! "
603,GUARD #1," Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.
        "
604,GUARD #2, Hic! 
605,FATHER," No, no. Until I come and get him. "
606,GUARD #1," Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the 
        room. "
607,FATHER," No, no. No. You stay in the room and make sure he 
        doesn't leave. "
608,GUARD #1, And you'll come and get him. 
609,GUARD #2, Hic! 
610,FATHER, Right. 
611,GUARD #1," We don't need to do anything apart from just stop 
        him entering the room. "
612,FATHER," No, no. Leaving the room. "
613,GUARD #1, Leaving the room. Yes. 
614,FATHER, All right? 
615,GUARD #1, Right. 
616,GUARD #2, Hic! 
617,FATHER, Right. 
618,GUARD #1," Oh, if-- if-- if, uhh-- if-- if-- w-- ehh-- i-- if-- 
        if we-- "
619,FATHER, Yes? What is it? 
620,GUARD #1," Oh, i-- if-- i-- oh-- "
621,FATHER," Look, it's quite simple. "
622,GUARD #1, Uh... 
623,FATHER," You just stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave the 
        room. All right? "
624,GUARD #2, Hic! 
625,FATHER, Right. 
626,GUARD #1," Oh, I remember. Uhh, can he leave the room with us?
        "
627,FATHER," N-- no, no. No. You just keep him in here and make 
        sure he-- "
628,GUARD #1," Oh, yes. We'll keep him in here, obviously, but if 
        he had to leave and we were with him-- "
629,FATHER," No, no, no, no. Just keep him in here-- "
630,GUARD #1, Until you or anyone else-- 
631,FATHER," No, not anyone else. Just me. "
632,GUARD #1, Just you. 
633,GUARD #2, Hic! 
634,FATHER, Get back. 
635,GUARD #1, Get back. 
636,FATHER, All right? 
637,GUARD #1, Right. We'll stay here until you get back. 
638,GUARD #2, Hic! 
639,FATHER," And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave. "
640,GUARD #1, What? 
641,FATHER, Make sure 'e doesn't leave. 
642,GUARD #1, The Prince? 
643,FATHER, Yes. Make sure 'e doesn't leave. 
644,GUARD #1," Oh, yes, of course. "
645,GUARD #2, Hic! 
646,GUARD #1," Ah. I thought you meant him. You know, it seemed a 
        bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard. "
647,FATHER, Is that clear? 
648,GUARD #2, Hic! 
649,GUARD #1," Oh, quite clear. No problems. "
650,FATHER, Right. Where are you going? 
651,GUARD #1, We're coming with you. 
652,FATHER," No, no. I want you to stay here and make sure 'e 
        doesn't leave. "
653,GUARD #1," Oh, I see. Right. "
654,HERBERT, But Father! 
655,FATHER," Shut your noise, you! And get that suit on! "
656,GUARD #2, Hic! 
657,FATHER," Oh, go and get a glass of water. "
658,LANCELOT," Well taken, 
        Concorde! "
659,CONCORDE," Thank you, sir! Most kind. "
660,LANCELOT," And again! Over we go! Good. Steady! And now, the 
        big one! Uuh! Come on, Concorde! "
661,CONCORDE," Message for you, sir. "
662,LANCELOT," Concorde! Concorde! Speak to me! 'To whoever finds 
        this note: I have been imprisoned by my father, who wishes me to marry 
        against my will. Please, please, please come and rescue me. I am in the 
        Tall Tower of Swamp Castle.' At last! A call! A cry of distress! This 
        could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail! Brave, brave 
        Concorde, you shall not have died in vain! "
663,CONCORDE," Uh, I'm-- I'm not quite dead, sir. "
664,LANCELOT," Well, you shall not have been mortally wounded in 
        vain! "
665,CONCORDE," I-- I-- I think I c-- I could pull through, sir. "
666,LANCELOT," Oh, I see. "
667,CONCORDE," Actually, I think I'm all right to come with you, 
        sir-- "
668,LANCELOT," No, no, sweet Concorde! Stay here! I will send help 
        as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own 
        particular... "
669,CONCORDE," Idiom, sir? "
670,LANCELOT, Idiom! 
671,CONCORDE," No, I feel fine, actually, sir. "
672,LANCELOT," Farewell, sweet Concorde! "
673,CONCORDE," I'll, um-- I'll just stay here, then. Shall I, sir? 
        Yeah. "
674,PRINCESS LUCKY and GIRLS, 
675,GUEST, 'Morning! 
676,SENTRY #1, 'Morning. 
677,SENTRY #2, Oooh. 
678,SENTRY #1, 
679,LANCELOT, Ha ha! Hiyya! 
680,SENTRY #2, Hey! 
681,LANCELOT," Hiyya!, Ha!, etc. "
682,PRINCESS LUCKY and GIRLS, 
683,LANCELOT, Ha ha! Huy! 
684,GUESTS, Uuh! Aaah! 
685,LANCELOT," Ha ha! And take this! Aah! Hiyah! Aah! Aaah! Hyy! 
        Hya! Hiyya! Ha!... "
686,GUARD #1," Now, you're not allowed to enter the room-- aaugh!
        "
687,LANCELOT," O fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir 
        Lancelot of Camelot. I have come to take y-- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
        "
688,HERBERT, You got my note! 
689,LANCELOT," Uh, well, I-- I got, uh, a note. "
690,HERBERT, You've come to rescue me! 
691,LANCELOT," Uh, well, no. You see, I hadn't-- "
692,HERBERT," I knew someone would. I knew that somewhere out 
        there... "
693,LANCELOT," Well, I-- "
694,HERBERT, ...there must be... someone... 
695,FATHER," Stop that! Stop that! Stop it! Stop it! Who are you?
        "
696,HERBERT, I'm your son! 
697,FATHER," No, not you. "
698,LANCELOT," Uh, I am Sir Lancelot, sir. "
699,HERBERT," He's come to rescue me, Father. "
700,LANCELOT," Well, let's not jump to conclusions. "
701,FATHER, Did you kill all those guards? 
702,LANCELOT," Uh... Oh, yes. Sorry. "
703,FATHER, They cost fifty pounds each! 
704,LANCELOT," Well, I'm awfully sorry. Um, I really can explain 
        everything. "
705,HERBERT," Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot. I've got a 
        rope all ready. "
706,FATHER, You killed eight wedding guests in all! 
707,LANCELOT," Well, uh, you see, the thing is, I thought your son 
        was a lady. "
708,FATHER, I can understand that. 
709,HERBERT," Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry! "
710,FATHER," Shut up! You only killed the bride's father, that's 
        all! "
711,LANCELOT," Well, I really didn't mean to... "
712,FATHER," Didn't mean to?! You put your sword right through his 
        head! "
713,LANCELOT," Oh, dear. Is he all right? "
714,FATHER," You even kicked the bride in the chest! This is going 
        to cost me a fortune! "
715,LANCELOT," Well, I can explain. I was in the forest, um, 
        riding north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see-- "
716,FATHER," Camelot? Are you from, uh, Camelot? "
717,HERBERT," Hurry, Sir Lancelot! "
718,LANCELOT," Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir. "
719,FATHER," Very nice castle, Camelot. Uh, very good pig country.
        "
720,LANCELOT, Is it? 
721,HERBERT, Hurry! I'm ready! 
722,FATHER," Would you, uh, like to come and have a drink? "
723,LANCELOT," Well, that-- that's, uh, awfully nice of you,...
        "
724,HERBERT, I am ready! 
725,LANCELOT," ...um, I mean to be so understanding. "
726,HERBERT, Oooh! 
727,LANCELOT," ...I'm afraid when I'm in this idiom, I sometimes 
        get a bit, uh, sort of carried away. "
728,FATHER," Oh, don't worry about that. "
729,HERBERT, Oooh! 
730,GUESTS, 
731,FATHER," Well, this is the main hall. We're going to have all 
        this knocked through and made into one big, uh, living room. "
732,GUEST, There he is! 
733,FATHER," Oh, bloody hell. "
734,LANCELOT, Ha ha ha! Hey! Ha ha! 
735,FATHER," Hold it! Stop it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! 
        Hold it! Please! "
736,LANCELOT," Sorry. Sorry. You see what I mean? I just get 
        carried away. I'm really most awfully sorry. Sorry! Sorry, everyone. "
737,GUEST #1, He's killed the best man! 
738,GUESTS, 
739,FATHER," Hold it! Hold it! Please! Hold it! This is Sir 
        Lancelot from the Court of Camelot, a very brave and influential 
        knight, and my special guest here today. "
740,LANCELOT, Hello. 
741,GUEST, He killed my auntie! 
742,GUESTS, 
743,FATHER," Please! Please! This is supposed to be a happy 
        occasion! Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who. We are here 
        today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the 
        holy wedlock. Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just 
        fallen to his death. "
744,GUESTS," Oh! Oh, no! "
745,FATHER," But I don't want to think I've not lost a son, so much 
        as... gained a daughter! "
746,GUEST #2, He's not quite dead! 
747,FATHER, Since the near fatal wounding of her father-- 
748,GUEST #2, He's getting better! 
749,FATHER," For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about 
        to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him. "
750,BRIDE'S FATHER, Uugh! 
751,GUEST #2," Oh, he's died! "
752,FATHER," And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her 
        old dad, in a very real and legally binding sense. "
753,LANCELOT, What? 
754,GUEST #2, Look! The dead Prince! 
755,GUESTS, Oooh! The dead Prince! 
756,CONCORDE, He's not quite dead. 
757,HERBERT," No, I feel much better. "
758,FATHER," You fell out of the Tall Tower, you creep! "
759,HERBERT," No, I was saved at the last minute. "
760,FATHER, How?! 
761,HERBERT," Well, I'll tell you. "
762,FATHER, Not like that! Not like that! No! Stop it! 
763,GUESTS, 
764,FATHER, Shut uuup! 
765,GUESTS, 
766,FATHER, Shut up! 
767,GUESTS, 
768,FATHER, Shut up! 
769,GUESTS, 
770,FATHER, Not like that! 
771,GUESTS, 
772,CONCORDE," Quickly, sir! "
773,GUESTS, 
774,CONCORDE, Come this way! 
775,GUESTS, 
776,LANCELOT, No! It's not right for my idiom! 
777,GUESTS, 
778,LANCELOT, I must escape more... 
779,GUESTS, 
780,CONCORDE," Dramatically, sir? "
781,LANCELOT, Dramatically! 
782,GUESTS, 
783,LANCELOT, Heee! Hoa! 
784,GUESTS, 
785,LANCELOT," Excuse me. Could, uh-- could somebody give me a 
        push, please? "
786,ARTHUR, Old crone! 
787,OLD CRONE, Who sent you? 
788,ARTHUR, The Knights Who Say 'Ni'. 
789,CRONE, Aggh! No! Never! We have no shrubberies here. 
790,ARTHUR," If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my 
        friend and I will say... we will say... 'ni'. "
791,CRONE, Agh! Do your worst! 
792,ARTHUR," Very well! If you will not assist us voluntarily,... 
        ni! "
793,CRONE, No! Never! No shrubberies! 
794,ARTHUR, Ni! 
795,CRONE, 
796,BEDEVERE, Nu! 
797,ARTHUR," No, no, no, no, i-- "
798,BEDEVERE, Nu! 
799,ARTHUR," No, it's not that. It's 'ni'. "
800,BEDEVERE, Nu! 
801,ARTHUR," No, no. 'Ni'. You're not doing it properly. No. "
802,BEDEVERE, Ni! 
803,ARTHUR and BEDEVERE, Ni! 
804,ARTHUR, That's it. That's it. You've got it. 
805,ARTHUR and BEDEVERE, Ni! 
806,CRONE, Ohh! 
807,BEDEVERE, Ni! 
808,ARTHUR, Ni! 
809,CRONE, Agh! 
810,BEDEVERE, Ni! 
811,ARTHUR, Ni! 
812,BEDEVERE, Ni! 
813,ARTHUR, Ni! 
814,BEDEVERE, Ni! 
815,ROGER THE SHRUBBER, Are you saying 'ni' to that old woman? 
816,ARTHUR," Erm,... yes. "
817,ROGER," Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can 
        say 'ni' at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land. 
        Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are 
        under considerable economic stress at this period in history. "
818,ARTHUR, Did you say 'shrubberies'? 
819,ROGER," Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name 
        is 'Roger the Shrubber'. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies. "
820,BEDEVERE, Ni! 
821,ARTHUR," No! No, no, no! No! "
822,ARTHUR," O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery. 
        May we go now? "
823,HEAD KNIGHT," It is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels 
        particularly,... but there is one small problem. "
824,ARTHUR, What is that? 
825,HEAD KNIGHT," We are now... no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.
        "
826,KNIGHTS OF NI, Ni! Shh! 
827,HEAD KNIGHT," Shh! We are now the Knights Who Say 
        'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zu-owly-zhiv'. "
828,RANDOM, Ni! 
829,HEAD KNIGHT," Therefore, we must give you a test. "
830,ARTHUR," What is this test, O Knights of-- knights who till 
        recently said 'ni'? "
831,HEAD KNIGHT," Firstly, you must find... another shrubbery! "
832,ARTHUR, Not another shrubbery! 
833,RANDOM, Ni! 
834,HEAD KNIGHT," Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must 
        place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the 
        two-level effect with a little path running down the middle. "
835,KNIGHTS OF NI," A path! A path! A path! Ni! Shh! Knights of Ni! 
        Ni! Ni! Shh! Shh!... "
836,HEAD KNIGHT," Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must 
        cut down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring! "
837,KNIGHTS OF NI, A herring! 
838,ARTHUR, We shall do no such thing! 
839,HEAD KNIGHT," Oh, please! "
840,ARTHUR, Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done. 
841,KNIGHTS OF NI, Aaaaugh! Aaaugh! 
842,HEAD KNIGHT, Augh! Ohh! Don't say that word. 
843,ARTHUR, What word? 
844,HEAD KNIGHT," I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words 
        the Knights of Ni cannot hear. "
845,ARTHUR," How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what 
        it is? "
846,KNIGHTS OF NI, Aaaaugh! 
847,HEAD KNIGHT, You said it again! 
848,ARTHUR," What, 'is'? "
849,KNIGHTS OF NI," Agh! No, not 'is'. "
850,HEAD KNIGHT," No, not 'is'. You wouldn't get vary far in life 
        not saying 'is'. "
851,KNIGHTS OF NI," No, not 'is'. Not 'is'. "
852,BEDEVERE," My liege, it's Sir Robin! "
853,MINSTREL, 
854,ARTHUR, Sir Robin! 
855,ROBIN, My liege! It's good to see you. 
856,HEAD KNIGHT, Now he's said the word! 
857,ARTHUR," Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy 
        Grail? "
858,MINSTREL, 
859,ROBIN," Shut up! No, no. No. Far from it. "
860,HEAD KNIGHT, He said the word again! 
861,KNIGHTS OF NI, Aaaaugh! 
862,ROBIN, I was looking for it. 
863,KNIGHTS OF NI, Aaaaugh! 
864,ROBIN," Uh, here-- here in this forest. "
865,ARTHUR," No, it is far from this place. "
866,KNIGHTS OF NI, Aaaaugh! 
867,HEAD KNIGHT, Aaaaugh! Stop saying the word! The word... 
868,ARTHUR," Oh, stop it! "
869,HEAD KNIGHT, ...we cannot hear! Ow! He said it again! 
870,ARTHUR, Patsy! 
871,HEAD KNIGHT, Wait! I said it! I said it! 
872,KNIGHTS OF NI, Aaaaugh!... Narrative Interlude 
873,NARRATOR," And so, Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on 
        their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in 
        scene twenty-four. Beyond the forest, they met Lancelot and Galahad, and 
        there was much rejoicing. "
874,KNIGHTS, Yay! Yay! 
875,NARRATOR," In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat 
        Robin's minstrels. "
876,MINSTREL, 
877,NARRATOR, And there was much rejoicing. 
878,KNIGHTS, Yay! 
879,NARRATOR, A year passed. 
880,CARTOON CHARACTER, 
881,NARRATOR, Winter changed into Spring. 
882,CARTOON CHARACTER," Mmm, nice. "
883,NARRATOR, Spring changed into Summer. 
884,CARTOON CHARACTER, Oh. Ahh. 
885,NARRATOR," Summer changed back into Winter,... "
886,CARTOON CHARACTER, Oh? 
887,NARRATOR," ...and Winter gave Spring and Summer a miss and went 
        straight on into Autumn. "
888,CARTOON CHARACTER, Aah. 
889,NARRATOR, Until one day... 
890,KNIGHTS, Eh. Oh. See it? Oh. Oh. 
891,ARTHUR, Knights! Forward! 
892,TIM, I... am an enchanter. 
893,ARTHUR, By what name are you known? 
894,TIM, There are some who call me... 'Tim'? 
895,ARTHUR," Greetings, Tim the Enchanter. "
896,TIM," Greetings, King Arthur! "
897,ARTHUR, You know my name? 
898,TIM, I do. 
899,ARTHUR," That is our quest. You know much that is hidden, O 
        Tim. "
900,TIM, Quite. 
901,ROBIN, Oh. 
902,ARTHUR," Yes, we're-- we're looking for the Holy Grail. Our 
        quest is to find the Holy Grail. "
903,KNIGHTS, Yeah. Yes. It is. It is. Yeah. Yup. Yup. Hm. Mm. 
904,ARTHUR," And so, we're-- we're-- we're looking for it. "
905,BEDEVERE," Yes, we are. "
906,GALAHAD, Yeah. 
907,ROBIN, We are. We are. 
908,BEDEVERE, We have been for some time. 
909,ROBIN, Ages. 
910,BEDEVERE, Umhm. 
911,ARTHUR," Uh-- uh, so, uh, anything that you could do to, uh-- 
        to help... would be... very... helpful. "
912,GALAHAD," Look, can you tell us where-- "
913,ARTHUR," Fine. Um, I don't want to waste any more of your time, 
        but, uh, I don't suppose you could, uh, tell us where we might find a, 
        um-- find a, uh-- a, um-- a, uh-- "
914,TIM, A what...? 
915,ARTHUR, A g-- a-- a g-- a g-- a-- a g-- 
916,TIM, A grail?! 
917,ARTHUR, Yes. I think so. 
918,ROBIN, Y-- y-- yes. 
919,ARTHUR, Yes. 
920,GALAHAD, Yup. 
921,KNIGHTS, That's it... 
922,TIM, Yes! 
923,ROBIN, Oh. 
924,ARTHUR, Oh. Thank you. 
925,ROBIN, Ahh. 
926,GALAHAD, Oh. Fine. 
927,ARTHUR, Thank you. 
928,ROBIN, Splendid. 
929,KNIGHTS, Aah... 
930,ARTHUR," Look, um, you're a busy man, uh-- "
931,TIM," Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail. "
932,KNIGHTS," Oh, thank you. Oh... "
933,TIM," To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- 
        wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last 
        words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged... "
934,ARTHUR," Where could we find this cave, O Tim? "
935,TIM," Follow. But! Follow only if ye be men of valour, for the 
        entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no 
        man yet has fought with it and lived! Bones of full fifty men lie strewn 
        about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your 
        strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, 
        pointy teeth. "
936,ARTHUR, What an eccentric performance. 
937,GALAHAD," They're nervous, sire. "
938,ARTHUR," Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot. 
        Dis-mount! "
939,TIM, Behold the cave of Caerbannog! 
940,ARTHUR, Right! Keep me covered. 
941,GALAHAD, What with? 
942,ARTHUR, W-- just keep me covered. 
943,TIM, Too late! 
944,ARTHUR, What? 
945,TIM, There he is! 
946,ARTHUR, Where? 
947,TIM, There! 
948,ARTHUR," What, behind the rabbit? "
949,TIM, It is the rabbit. 
950,ARTHUR, You silly sod! 
951,TIM, What? 
952,ARTHUR, You got us all worked up! 
953,TIM," Well, that's no ordinary rabbit! "
954,ARTHUR, Ohh. 
955,TIM," That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you 
        ever set eyes on! "
956,ROBIN, You tit! I soiled my armor I was so scared! 
957,TIM," Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide! 
        It's a killer! "
958,GALAHAD, Get stuffed! 
959,TIM," He'll do you up a treat, mate. "
960,GALAHAD," Oh, yeah? "
961,ROBIN, You mangy Scots git! 
962,TIM, I'm warning you! 
963,ROBIN," What's he do, nibble your bum? "
964,TIM," He's got huge, sharp-- eh-- he can leap about-- look at 
        the bones! "
965,ARTHUR," Go on, Bors. Chop his head off! "
966,BORS," Right! Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew comin' 
        right up! "
967,TIM, Look! 
968,BORS, Aaaugh! 
969,ARTHUR, Jesus Christ! 
970,TIM, I warned you! 
971,ROBIN, I done it again! 
972,TIM," I warned you, but did you listen to me? Oh, no, you knew 
        it all, didn't you? Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it? 
        Well, it's always the same. I always tell them-- "
973,ARTHUR," Oh, shut up! "
974,TIM, Do they listen to me? 
975,ARTHUR, Right! 
976,TIM," Oh, no... "
977,KNIGHTS, Charge! 
978,KNIGHTS," Aaaaugh!, Aaaugh!, etc. "
979,ARTHUR, Run away! Run away! 
980,KNIGHTS, Run away! Run away!... 
981,TIM, Ha ha ha ha! Ha haw haw! Ha! Ha ha! 
982,ARTHUR, Right. How many did we lose? 
983,LANCELOT, Gawain. 
984,GALAHAD, Ector. 
985,ARTHUR, And Bors. That's five. 
986,GALAHAD," Three, sir. "
987,ARTHUR," Three. Three. And we'd better not risk another frontal 
        assault. That rabbit's dynamite. "
988,ROBIN, Would it help to confuse it if we run away more? 
989,ARTHUR," Oh, shut up and go and change your armor. "
990,GALAHAD," Let us taunt it! It may become so cross that it will 
        make a mistake. "
991,ARTHUR, Like what? 
992,GALAHAD, Well... ooh. 
993,LANCELOT, Have we got bows? 
994,ARTHUR, No. 
995,LANCELOT, We have the Holy Hand Grenade. 
996,ARTHUR," Yes, of course! The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch! 'Tis 
        one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him! Brother 
        Maynard! Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade! "
997,MONKS, 
998,ARTHUR," How does it, um-- how does it work? "
999,LANCELOT," I know not, my liege. "
1000,ARTHUR, Consult the Book of Armaments! 
1001,BROTHER MAYNARD," Armaments, chapter two, verses nine to 
        twenty-one. "
1002,SECOND BROTHER," And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on 
        high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this Thy hand grenade that, with it, Thou 
        mayest blow Thine enemies to tiny bits in Thy mercy.' And the Lord did 
        grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and 
        anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large 
        chu-- "
1003,MAYNARD," Skip a bit, Brother. "
1004,SECOND BROTHER," And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou 
        take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No 
        less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the 
        counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count 
        thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. 
        Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest 
        thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being 
        naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.' "
1005,MAYNARD, Amen. 
1006,KNIGHTS, Amen. 
1007,ARTHUR, Right! One!... Two!... Five! 
1008,GALAHAD," Three, sir! "
1009,ARTHUR, Three! 
1010,ARTHUR, There! Look! 
1011,LANCELOT, What does it say? 
1012,GALAHAD, What language is that? 
1013,ARTHUR, Brother Maynard! You are a scholar. 
1014,MAYNARD, It's Aramaic! 
1015,GALAHAD, Of course! Joseph of Arimathea! 
1016,LANCELOT, 'Course! 
1017,ARTHUR, What does it say? 
1018,MAYNARD," It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph 
        of Arimathea. He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy 
        Grail in the Castle of aaarrrrggh'. "
1019,ARTHUR, What? 
1020,MAYNARD, '...The Castle of aaarrrrggh'. 
1021,BEDEVERE, What is that? 
1022,MAYNARD, He must have died while carving it. 
1023,LANCELOT," Oh, come on! "
1024,MAYNARD," Well, that's what it says. "
1025,ARTHUR," Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 
        'aarrggh'. He'd just say it! "
1026,MAYNARD," Well, that's what's carved in the rock! "
1027,GALAHAD, Perhaps he was dictating. 
1028,ARTHUR," Oh, shut up. Well, does it say anything else? "
1029,MAYNARD, No. Just 'aaarrrrggh'. 
1030,LANCELOT, Aaaauugggh. 
1031,ARTHUR, Aarrrggh. 
1032,BEDEVERE, Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue? 
1033,GALAHAD, Where's that? 
1034,BEDEVERE," France, I think. "
1035,LANCELOT, Isn't there a 'Saint Aaauuves' in Cornwall? 
1036,ARTHUR," No, that's 'Saint Ives'. "
1037,LANCELOT," Oh, yes. Saint Iiiiives. "
1038,KNIGHTS, Iiiiives. 
1039,BEDEVERE, Oooohoohohooo! 
1040,LANCELOT," No, no. 'Aaaauugggh', at the back of the throat. 
        Aaauugh. "
1041,BEDEVERE," N-- no. No, no, no, no. 'Oooooooh', in surprise and 
        alarm. "
1042,LANCELOT," Oh, you mean sort of a 'aaaah'! "
1043,BEDEVERE," Yes, but I-- aaaaaah! "
1044,ARTHUR, Oooh! 
1045,GALAHAD, My God! 
1046,MAYNARD, It's the legendary Black Beast of Aaarrrrggh! 
1047,BEDEVERE, That's it! That's it! 
1048,ARTHUR, Run away! 
1049,KNIGHTS, Run away! 
1050,BEDEVERE, We've lost him. 
1051,KNIGHTS, Aagh! 
1052,NARRATOR," As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape 
        for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless, when suddenly, the animator 
        suffered a fatal heart attack. "
1053,ANIMATOR, Ulk! 
1054,NARRATOR," The cartoon peril was no more. The quest for Holy 
        Grail could continue. "
1055,GALAHAD, There it is! 
1056,ARTHUR, The Bridge of Death! 
1057,ROBIN," Oh, great. "
1058,ARTHUR, Look! There's the old man from scene twenty-four! 
1059,BEDEVERE, What is he doing here? 
1060,ARTHUR," He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death. He asks each 
        traveller five questions-- "
1061,GALAHAD, Three questions. 
1062,ARTHUR," Three questions. He who answers the five questions--
        "
1063,GALAHAD, Three questions. 
1064,ARTHUR, Three questions may cross in safety. 
1065,ROBIN, What if you get a question wrong? 
1066,ARTHUR, Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. 
1067,ROBIN," Oh, I won't go. "
1068,GALAHAD, Who's going to answer the questions? 
1069,ARTHUR, Sir Robin! 
1070,ROBIN, Yes? 
1071,ARTHUR," Brave Sir Robin, you go. "
1072,ROBIN," Hey! I've got a great idea. Why doesn't Lancelot go?
        "
1073,LANCELOT," Yes. Let me go, my liege. I will take him 
        single-handed. I shall make a feint to the north-east that s-- "
1074,ARTHUR," No, no. No. Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Just answer the 
        five questions-- "
1075,GALAHAD, Three questions. 
1076,ARTHUR," Three questions as best you can, and we shall watch... 
        and pray. "
1077,LANCELOT," I understand, my liege. "
1078,ARTHUR," Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot. God be with you. "
1079,BRIDGEKEEPER," Stop! Who would cross the Bridge of Death must 
        answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see. "
1080,LANCELOT," Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. I am not 
        afraid. "
1081,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is your name? 
1082,LANCELOT, My name is 'Sir Lancelot of Camelot'. 
1083,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is your quest? 
1084,LANCELOT, To seek the Holy Grail. 
1085,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is your favorite color? 
1086,LANCELOT, Blue. 
1087,BRIDGEKEEPER, Right. Off you go. 
1088,LANCELOT," Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. "
1089,ROBIN, That's easy! 
1090,BRIDGEKEEPER," Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death must 
        answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see. "
1091,ROBIN," Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. I'm not afraid. "
1092,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is your name? 
1093,ROBIN, 'Sir Robin of Camelot'. 
1094,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is your quest? 
1095,ROBIN, To seek the Holy Grail. 
1096,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is the capital of Assyria? 
1097,ROBIN, I don't know that! Auuuuuuuugh! 
1098,BRIDGEKEEPER, Stop! What... is your name? 
1099,GALAHAD, 'Sir Galahad of Camelot'. 
1100,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is your quest? 
1101,GALAHAD, I seek the Grail. 
1102,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is your favorite color? 
1103,GALAHAD," Blue. No, yel-- auuuuuuuugh! "
1104,BRIDGEKEEPER, Hee hee heh. Stop! What... is your name? 
1105,ARTHUR," It is 'Arthur', King of the Britons. "
1106,BRIDGEKEEPER, What... is your quest? 
1107,ARTHUR, To seek the Holy Grail. 
1108,BRIDGEKEEPER," What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen 
        swallow? "
1109,ARTHUR, What do you mean? An African or European swallow? 
1110,BRIDGEKEEPER, Huh? I-- I don't know that. Auuuuuuuugh! 
1111,BEDEVERE, How do know so much about swallows? 
1112,ARTHUR," Well, you have to know these things when you're a 
        king, you know. "
1113,ARTHUR," Lancelot! 
        Lancelot! Lancelot!"
1114,BEDEVERE, Lancelot! Lancelot!
1115,ARTHUR, Lancelot!
1116,BEDEVERE, Lancelot! Lancelot!
1117,ARTHUR," The Castle Arrrggh. Our quest is at an end! God be 
        praised! Almighty God, we thank Thee that Thou hast vouchsafed to us the 
        most holy--"
1118,FRENCH GUARD," Allo, dappy English k-niggets and Monsieur 
        Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck, you know. So, we French 
        fellows outwit you a second time!"
1119,ARTHUR," How dare you profane this place with your presence! I 
        command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, to open the doors of 
        this sacred castle, to which God Himself has guided us!"
1120,FRENCH GUARD," How you English say, 'I one more time, mac, 
        unclog my nose in your direction', sons of a window-dresser! So, you 
        think you could out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent 
        running about advancing behavior?! I wave my private parts at your 
        aunties, you cheesy lot of second hand electric donkey-bottom biters.
        "
1121,ARTHUR," In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this 
        sacred castle!"
1122,FRENCH GUARD," No chance, English bed-wetting types. I burst my 
        pimples at you and call your door-opening request a silly thing, you 
        tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!"
1123,ARTHUR," If you do not open this door, we shall take this 
        castle by force!"
1124,FRENCH GUARDS, 
1125,ARTHUR, Agh. Right! That settles it!
1126,FRENCH GUARD," Yes, depart a lot at this time and cut the 
        approaching any more, or we fire arrows at the tops of your heads and 
        make castanets out of your testicles already! Ha ha haaa ha!"
1127,ARTHUR, Walk away. Just ignore them.
1128,FRENCH GUARD," And now, remain gone, illegitimate-faced 
        bugger-folk! And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you 
        ain't heard nothing yet, dappy English k-nnniggets! Thpppt!"
1129,FRENCH GUARDS, 
1130,ARTHUR, We shall attack at once!
1131,BEDEVERE," Yes, my liege!"
1132,ARTHUR, Stand by for attack!
1133,FRENCH GUARDS, 
1134,ARTHUR," Today the blood of many a valiant knight shall be 
        avenged. In the name of God,..."
1135,FRENCH GUARDS," Hoo hoo! Ohh, ha ha ha ha ha!..."
1136,ARTHUR," ...we shall not stop our fight till each one of you 
        lies dead and the Holy Grail returns to those whom God has chosen!"
1137,FRENCH GUARDS, ...Ha ha ha!...
1138,ARTHUR, Charge!
1139,ARMY OF KNIGHTS, Hooray!
1140,HISTORIAN'S WIFE," Yes, they're the ones. I'm sure."
1141,INSPECTOR," Come on. Anybody armed must go, too."
1142,OFFICER #1, All right. Come on. Back.
1143,HISTORIAN'S WIFE, Get that one.
1144,OFFICER #1, Back. Right away.
1145,HISTORIAN'S WIFE, Yes.
1146,OFFICER #1, Just... pull it off. Come on. Come along.
1147,INSPECTOR, Put this man in the van.
1148,OFFICER #1, Clear off. Come on.
1149,BEDEVERE, With whom?
1150,INSPECTOR, Which one?
1151,OFFICER #1, Oh-- this one.
1152,INSPECTOR, Come on. Put him in the van.
1153,OFFICER #2, Get a blanket.
1154,OFFICER #1, We have no hospital.
1155,RANDOM, Ahh.
1156,RANDOM, Ooh.
1157,OFFICER #1, Come on. Back. Riiight back. Come on!
1158,OFFICER #2, Run along! Run along!
1159,OFFICER #1," Pull that off. My, that's an offensive weapon, 
        that is."
1160,OFFICER #2," Come on. Back with 'em. Back. Right. Come along.
        "
1161,INSPECTOR, Everything?
1162,OFFICER #1," All right, sonny. That's enough. Just pack that 
        in."
1163,CAMERAMAN, Christ!
