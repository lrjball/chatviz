0,Eric Idle," Hello. Tonight on 'Face the Press' we're 
            going to examine two different views of contemporary things. On my 
            left is the Minister for Home Affairs "
1,Graham Chapman," No, no. I'd like to answer this question if I 
            may in two ways. Firsfly in my normal voice and then in a kind of 
            silly high-pitched whine... You see housing is a problem really...
            "
2,Eric Idle," Well, while the minister is answering this 
            question I'd just like to point out the minister's dress has been 
            made entirely by hand from over three hundred pieces of Arabian shot 
            silk "
3,Graham Chapman, Don't I say any more? 
4,Eric Idle," No fear! Today saw the appointment of a new 
            head of Allied Bomber Command - Air Chief Marshal Sir Vincent 'Kill 
            the Japs' Forseer. He's in our Birmingham studio... "
5,John Cleese," Hello Sailors! Listen, guess what. The 
            Minister of Aviation has made me head of the RAF Ola Pola. "
0,Michael Palin, Hello. Mrs. Rogers? 
1,Terry Jones," No. Ooh I must be in the wrong house, "
2,John Cleese," So from now on we're going to do things my 
            way. For a start David Hockhey is going to design the bombs. And 
            I've seen the plans... "
3,Terry Jones, That must be the new gas cooker. 
4,Michael Palin, Morning. Mrs. G. Crump? 
5,Terry Jones, No - Mrs. G. Pinnet. 
6,Michael Palin, This is 46 Egernon Crescent? 
7,Terry Jones, No - Road. Egernon Road. 
8,Michael Palin, 
9,Terry Jones," Oh there's nobody here of that name. It's 
            Mrs. G. Pinnet. 46 Egernon Road. "
10,Michael Palin," Well it says 'Crump' here. Don't it, Harry?
            "
11,Graham Chapman, Yeah - it's on the invoice. 
12,Michael Palin," Yeah, definitely Crump. "
13,Terry Jones," Well there must have been a mistake, because 
            the address is right, and that's definitely the cooker I ordered - a 
            blue and white CookEasy. "
14,Michael Palin," Well you can't have this. This is Crump.
            "
15,Terry Jones," Oh dear, what are we going to do? "
16,Michael Palin," Well I don't know. What we can do for you 
            is take it back to the Depot, get a transfer slip from Crump to 
            Pinnet, and put it on a special delivery. "
17,Graham Chapman," Yeah - that's best. We'll special it for 
            you, we'll get it down there today and you'll get it back in ten 
            weeks. "
18,Terry Jones," Ten weeks! Blimey, can't you just leave this 
            one? "
19,Michael Palin, What this? What leave it here? 
20,Terry Jones, Yes. 
21,Michael Palin, Well I dunno. I suppose we could. 
22,Graham Chapman," Oh, but she'd have to fill out a temporary 
            dispatch note. "
23,Michael Palin," Yeah we could leave it on a temporary 
            dispatch note. "
24,Terry Jones," Well that's sorted out then. What a mess, 
            isn't it. "
25,Michael Palin," I know, it's ridiculous really, but there 
            you are. Glad we could be of such a help. Right, would you sign it 
            down there please, Mrs. Crump? "
26,Terry Jones, Pinnet. 
27,Michael Palin," Pinnet. Listen, just for the books make it 
            a bit easier, could you sign it Crump-Pinnet. "
28,Terry Jones, Right. 
29,Michael Palin," Right. Thank you very much, dear. The 
            cooker's yours. Right. Thank you very much, dear. Right. "
30,Graham Chapman," Cheerio, Mrs. Crump! "
31,Terry Jones," Heh, excuse me! Cooey! Er, can you put it in 
            the kitchen? "
32,Michael Palin, 
33,Terry Jones," Well I can't cook on it unless it's connected 
            up. "
34,Michael Palin," Oh we didn't realize you had an 
            installation invoice. "
35,Graham Chapman, An MI. 
36,Michael Palin," No, we can't touch it without an MI, you 
            see. "
37,Graham Chapman, Or an RI6. 
38,John Cleese, 
39,Graham Chapman," Nah - it's not special ... the special's 
            back at the Depot. "
40,Michael Palin," No, the special's the same as installation 
            invoice. "
41,John Cleese, So it's an RI6. 
42,Terry Jones, What's an installation invoice? 
43,Michael Palin, A pink form from Reading. 
44,Terry Jones," Oh - we wondered what that was. Now these are 
            the forms. "
45,Michael Palin," That's the one, love. Yeah, this should be 
            all I need. Hang on. This is for Pinnet. Mrs. G. Pinnet. "
46,Terry Jones, That's right. I'm Mrs. G. Pinnet. 
47,Michael Palin," Well we've got Crump-Pinnet on the invoice.
            "
48,Terry Jones, Well shall I sign it Crump-Pinnet then? 
49,Michael Palin," No, no, no - not an MI - no. "
50,Graham Chapman," No - that's from Area Service at Reading.
            "
51,Eric Idle, 
52,Graham Chapman," No, not this side of the street. "
53,Terry Jones, Look I just want it connected up. 
54,John Cleese, What about London Office? 
55,Michael Palin, Well they haven't got the machinery. 
56,Graham Chapman, Not now. 
57,Terry Gilliam, 
58,Eric Idle," No - they're still on standard pressure.
            "
59,Terry Jones," But surely they can connect up a gas cooker?
            "
60,Michael Palin," Oh yeah, we could connect it up, love, but 
            not unless it's an emergency. "
61,Terry Jones, But this is an emergency. 
62,Michael Palin," No it's not. An emergency is 290... 'where 
            there is actual or apparent loss of combustible gaseous substances'.
            "
63,Graham Chapman," Yeah, it's like a leak. "
64,John Cleese, No - that's valve adjustment. 
65,Terry Jones," But there can't be a leak unless you've 
            connected it up. "
66,Michael Palin," No, quite. We'd have to turn it on. "
67,Terry Jones," Well can't you turn it on and connect it up?
            "
68,Michael Palin," No. But what we can do, and this is between 
            you and me, I shouldn't really be telling you this, we'll turn your 
            gas on, make a hole in your pipe, you ring Hounslow emergency, 
            they'll be around here in a couple of days. "
69,Terry Jones," What, a house full of gas! Ca be dead by then
            "
70,Michael Palin," Oh well, in that case you'd have the South 
            East Area Manager round here like a shot. "
71,Terry Jones, Really? 
72,Michael Palin," Ah yes. 'One or more persons overcome by 
            fumes', you'd have Head Office, Holbom, round here. "
73,Terry Jones, Really? 
74,Michael Palin, Yes. That's murder you see. 
75,Graham Chapman, Or suicide. 
76,Terry Gilliam, No. That's S42. 
77,Graham Chapman, Oh. 
78,Terry Gilliam," No - Central area and Southall Marketing 
            Division, they're both on the S42 now. "
79,Terry Jones, And they'd be able to connect it up? 
80,Michael Palin," Oh - they'd do the lot for you, love. "
81,Terry Jones, And they'd come round this afternoon? 
82,Michael Palin," ... Well what is it now... 11:30 · · · 
            murder... they'll be round here by two. "
83,Terry Jones, Oh well that's wonderful. 
84,Michael Palin," Oh well, right love, if you'd like to lie 
            down here. "
85,Terry Jones, All fight. 
86,Michael Palin, Okay Harry. 
87,Graham Chapman, Okay. Gas on. 
88,Michael Palin, 
89,Eric Idle, Shall I go through maintenance? 
90,Terry Gilliam," No, you'd better go through Deptford 
            maintenance. "
0,Eric Idle, Good morning. 
1,Terry Jones," Good morning, sir. Can I help you? "
2,Eric Idle," Help me? Yeah, I'll say you can help me. "
3,Terry Jones," Yes, sir? "
4,Eric Idle," I come about your advert - 'Small white pussy 
            cat for sale. Excellent condition'. "
5,Terry Jones, Ah. You wish to buy it? 
6,Eric Idle," That's right. Just for the hour. Only I ain't 
            gonna pay more'n a fiver cos it ain't worth it. "
7,Terry Jones," Well it's come from a very good home - it's 
            house trained. "
8,Eric Idle, 
9,Terry Jones," Yes, sir. "
10,Eric Idle, Does it go? 
11,Terry Jones," Er, it's over there in the corner. "
12,Eric Idle, Oh. 
13,Terry Jones," Ah yes, sir. That's in good condition. "
14,Eric Idle," Oh good, I like them in good condition, eh? Eh?
            "
15,Terry Jones," Yes, here it is you see. "
16,Eric Idle, 
17,Terry Jones, Babysitter. 
18,Eric Idle," Babysitter - I don't want a babysitter. Be a 
            blood donor - that's it. I'd like to give some blood please, argh!
            "
0,John Cleese, 'Times' please. 
1,Terry Jones," Oh yes sir, here you are. "
2,John Cleese, Thank you. 
3,Terry Jones, Cheers. 
4,John Cleese," Good morning. I'm sorry to have kept you 
            waiting, but I'm afraid my walk has become rather sillier recently, 
            and so it takes me rather longer to get to work. "
5,John Cleese, I see. May I see your silly walk? 
6,John Cleese," That's it, is it? "
7,John Cleese," It's not particularly silly, is it? I mean, the 
            right leg isn't silly at all and the left leg merely does a forward 
            aerial half turn every alternate step. "
8,John Cleese, 
9,John Cleese, 
10,John Cleese," ... Out of her mind. Now the Japanese have a man 
            who can bend his leg back over his head and back again with every 
            single step. While the Israelis... here's the coffee. "
11,John Cleese, Thank you - lovely. 
12,John Cleese," Well take a look at this, then. "
13,John Cleese," Now Mr. Pudey. I'm not going to mince words with 
            you. I'm going to offer you a Research Fellowship on the 
            Anglo-French "
0,Eric Idle," And now a choice of viewing on BBC Television. 
            Just started on BBC2, the semi final of Episode 3 of 'Kierkegaard's 
            Journals', staring Richard Chamberlain, Peggy Mount and Billy 
            Bremer, and on BBC1, 'Ethel the Frog'"
1,John Cleese," Good evening. On 'Ethel the Frog' tonight we 
            look at violence The violence of British Gangland. Last Tuesday a 
            reign of terror was ended when the notorious Piranha brothers, Doug 
            and Dinsdale, after one of the most extraordinary trials in British 
            legal history, were sentenced to 400 years imprisonment for crimes 
            of violence. We examined the rise to power of the Piranhas, the 
            methods they used to subjugate rival gangs and their subsequent 
            tracking down and capture by the brilliant Superintendent Harry 
            'Snapper' Organs of Q Division. Doug and Dinsdale Piranha were born, 
            on probation, in a small house in Kipling Road, Southwark, the 
            eldest sons in a family of sixteen. Their father Arthur Piranha, a 
            scrap metal dealer and TV quizmaster, was well known to the police, 
            and a devout Catholic. In 1928 he had married Kitty Malone, an 
            up-and-coming East End boxer. Doug was born in February 1929 and 
            Dinsdale two weeks later; and again a week after that. Someone who 
            remembers them well was their next door neighbor, Mrs. April Simmel."
2,Michael Palin," Oh yes Kipling Road was a typical East End 
            Street, people were in and out of each other's houses with each 
            other's property all day. They were a cheery lot. "
3,Eric Idle, Was it a terribly violent area
4,Michael Palin," Oh no......yes. Cheerful and violent. I 
            remember Doug was keen on boxing, but when he learned to walk he 
            took up putting the boot in the groin. He was very interested in 
            that. His mother had a terrible job getting him to come in for tea. 
            Putting his little boot in he'd be, bless him. All the kids were 
            like that then, they didn't have their heads stuffed with all this 
            Cartesian dualism."
5,John Cleese," At the age of fifteen Doug and Dinsdale started 
            attending the Ernest Pythagoras Primary School in Clerkenwell. When 
            the Piranhas left school they were called up but were found by an 
            Army Board to be too unstable even for National Service. Denied the 
            opportunity to use their talents in the service of their country, 
            they began to operate what they called 'The Operation'... They would 
            select a victim and then threaten to beat him up if he paid the 
            so-called protection money. Four months later they started another 
            operation which the called 'The Other Operation'. In this racket 
            they selected another victim and threatened not to beat him up if he 
            didn't pay them. One month later they hit upon 'The Other Other 
            Operation'. In this the victim was threatened that if he didn't pay 
            them, they would beat him up. This for the Piranha brothers was the 
            turning point."
6,Terry Jones," Doug and Dinsdale Piranha now formed a gang, which 
            the called 'The Gang' and used terror to take over night clubs, 
            billiard halls, gaming casinos and race tracks. When they tried to 
            take over the MCC they were for the only time in their lives, slit 
            up a treat. As their empire spread however, Q Division were keeping 
            tabs on their every move by reading the color supplements."
7,John Cleese," One small-time operator who fell foul of 
            Dinsdale Piranha was Vince Snetterton-Lewis."
8,Graham Chapman," ""Well one day I was at home threatening the kids 
            when I looks out through the hole in the wall and sees this tank 
            pull up and out gets one of Dinsdale's boys, so he comes in nice and 
            friendly and says Dinsdale wants to have a word with me, so he 
            chains me to the back of the tank and takes me for a scrape round to 
            Dinsdale's place and Dinsdale's there in the conversation pit with 
            Doug and Charles Paisley, the baby crusher, and two film producers 
            and a man they called 'Kierkegaard', who just sat there biting the 
            heads of whippets and Dinsdale says 'I hear you've been a naughty 
            boy Clement' and he splits me nostrils open and saws me leg off and 
            pulls me liver out and I tell him my name's not Clement and then... 
            he loses his temper and nails me head to the floor."""
9,Eric Idle, He nailed your head to the floor?
10,Graham Chapman, At first yeah
11,John Cleese," Another man who had his head nailed to the 
            floor was Stig O' Tracy."
12,Eric Idle," I've been told Dinsdale Piranha nailed your 
            head to the floor."
13,Eric Idle," No. Never. He was a smashing bloke. He used to buy 
            his mother flowers and that. He was like a brother to me."
14,Eric Idle," But the police have film of Dinsdale actually 
            nailing your head to the floor."
15,Eric Idle, 
16,Eric Idle, Why?
17,Eric Idle," Well he had to, didn't he? I mean there was nothing 
            else he could do, be fair. I had transgressed the unwritten law."
18,Eric Idle, What had you done?
19,Eric Idle," Er... well he didn't tell me that, but he gave me 
            his word that it was the case, and that's good enough for me with 
            old Dinsy. I mean, he didn't *want* to nail my head to the floor. I 
            had to insist. He wanted to let me off. He'd do anything for you, 
            Dinsdale would."
20,Eric Idle, And you don't bear him a grudge?
21,Eric Idle, A grudge! Old Dinsy. He was a real darling.
22,Eric Idle," I understand he also nailed your wife's head 
            to a coffee table. Isn't that true Mrs. O' Tracy?"
23,Eric Idle," Well he did do that, yeah. He was a hard man. 
            Vicious but fair"
24,Eric Idle," Vince, after he nailed your head to the 
            floor, did you ever see him again"
25,Graham Chapman," Yeah.....after that I used to go round his flat 
            every Sunday lunchtime to apologize and we'd shake hands and then 
            he'd nail my head to the floor"
26,Eric Idle, Every Sunday?
27,Graham Chapman," Yeah but he was very reasonable. Once, one Sunday I 
            told him my parents were coming round to tea and would he mind very 
            much not nailing my head that week and he agreed and just screwed my 
            pelvis to a cake stand."
28,John Cleese," Clearly Dinsdale inspired tremendous fear among 
            his business associates. But what was he really like?"
29,John Cleese,"I walked out with Dinsdale on many occasions and 
            found him a charming and erudite companion. He was wont to introduce 
            one to eminent celebrities, celebrated American singers, members of 
            the aristocracy and other gang leaders,"
30,Eric Idle, How had he met them?
31,John Cleese," Through his work for charities. He took a warm 
            interest in Boys' Clubs, Sailors' Homes, Choristers' Associations 
            and the Grenadier Guards."
32,Eric Idle, Was there anything unusual about him?
33,John Cleese," Not him. I should say not. Except, that Dinsdale 
            was convinced that he was being watched by a giant hedgehog whom he 
            referred to as 'Spiny Norman'. "
34,Eric Idle, How big was Norman supposed to be?
35,John Cleese," Normally Spiny Norman was wont to be about twelve 
            feet from snout to tail, but when Dinsdale was depressed Norman 
            could be anything up to eight hundred yards long. When Norman was 
            about Dinsdale would go very quiet and start wobbling and his nose 
            would swell up and his teeth would move about and he'd get very 
            violent and claim that he'd laid Stanley Baldwin."""
36,Eric Idle," ""Did it worry you that he, for example, 
            stitched people's legs together?"""
37,John Cleese," ""Well it's better than bottling it up isn't it. He 
            was a gentleman, Dinsdale, and what's more he knew how to treat a 
            female impersonator."""
38,John Cleese," But what do the criminologists think? We asked 
            The Amazing Kargol and Janet:"
39,Graham Chapman," It is easy for us to judge Dinsdale Piranha 
            too harshly. After all he only did what many of us simply dream of 
            doing... I'm sorry. After all we should remember that a murderer is 
            only an extroverted suicide. Dinsdale was a looney, but he was a 
            happy looney. Lucky bugger."""
40,John Cleese," Most of the strange tales concern Dinsdale, but 
            what about Doug? One man who met him was Luigi Vercotti."
41,Michael Palin," I had been running a successful escort agency -- 
            high class, no really, high class girls -- we didn't have any of 
            *that* -- that was right out. And I decided "
42,Eric Idle, How much did they want?
43,Michael Palin," They wanted three quarters of a million pounds.
            "
44,Eric Idle, Why didn't you call the police?
45,Michael Palin," Well I had noticed that the lad with the 
            thermonuclear device was the chief constable for the area. So a week 
            later they called again and told me the check had bounced and 
            said... I had to see... Doug."
46,Eric Idle, Doug?
47,Michael Palin, Doug 
48,Eric Idle, What did he do?
49,Michael Palin," He used... sarcasm. He knew all the tricks, 
            dramatic irony, metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and... 
            satire. He was vicious."
50,John Cleese," By a combination of violence and sarcasm, the 
            Piranha brothers by February 1966 controlled London and the 
            Southeast of England. It was in February, though, that Dinsdale made 
            a big mistake."
51,John Cleese," Lately Dinsdale had become increasingly worried 
            about Spiny Norman. He had come to the conclusion that Norman slept 
            in an aeroplane hangar at Luton Airport. "
52,John Cleese," And so on Feb 22nd 1966, Dinsdale blew up 
            Luton. "
53,Terry Jones," The Piranhas realized they had gone too far and 
            that the hunt was on. They went into hiding. I decided on a subtle 
            approach, viz. some form of disguise, as the old helmet and boots 
            are a bit of a giveaway. Luckily my years with Bristol Rep. stood me 
            in good stead, as I assumed a bewildering variety of disguises. I 
            tracked them to Cardiff, posing as the Reverend Smiler Egret. 
            Hearing they'd gone back to London, I assumed the identity of a pork 
            butcher, Brian Stoats. On my arrival in London, I discovered they 
            had returned to Cardiff, I followed as Gloucester from _King Lear_. 
            Acting on a hunch I spent several months in Buenos Aires as Blind 
            Pew, returning through the Panama Canal as Ratty, in _Toad of Toad 
            Hall_. Back in Cardiff, I relived my triumph as Sancho Panza in _Man 
            of la Mancha_ which the ""Bristol Evening Post"" described as 'a 
            glittering performance of rare perception', although the ""Bath 
            Chronicle"" was less than enthusiastic. In fact it gave me a right 
            panning. I quote"
54,Eric Idle," As for the performance of Superintendent Harry 
            ""Snapper"" Organs as Sancho Panza, the audience were bemused by his 
            high-pitched Welsh accent and intimidated by his abusive ad-libs.
            "
55,Terry Jones, 
56,John Cleese," 'Sancho Panza (Mr. Organs) spoilt an otherwise 
            impeccably choreographed rape scene by his unscheduled appearance 
            and persistent cries of ""What's all this then?""'"
57,Graham Chapman, Never mind Snapper love you can't win 'em all
58,Terry Jones, True constable. Could I have my eye-liner please?
59,Graham Chapman, Telegram for you love
60,Terry Jones, Good-oh Bet it's from Binkie

            from the gentleman waiting outside"
62,Terry Jones, Oh good
63,Graham Chapman, Thirty second superintendent
64,Terry Jones," Oh blimey, I'm on. Is me hat on straight constable"
65,Graham Chapman, Oh it's fine
66,Terry Jones, Right here we gone then Hawkins
67,Graham Chapman," Oh, merde superintendent"
68,Terry Jones, Good luck then
0,John Cleese," And now for something completely 
            different."
0,Graham Chapman, Trouble at mill. 
1,Carol Cleveland, Oh no - what kind of trouble? 
2,Graham Chapman, One on't cross beams gone owt askew on treddle. 
3,Carol Cleveland, Pardon? 
4,Graham Chapman, One on't cross beams gone owt askew on treddle. 
5,Carol Cleveland, I don't understand what you're saying. 
6,Graham Chapman, 
7,Carol Cleveland, Well what on earth does that mean? 
8,Graham Chapman," *I* don't know - Mr. Wentworth just told me to come 
            in here and say that there was trouble at the mill, that's all - I 
            didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition. "
9,Michael Palin," NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition! Our chief 
            weapon is surprise...surprise and fear...fear and surprise.... Our 
            two weapons are fear and surprise...and ruthless efficiency.... Our 
            *three* weapons are fear, surprise, and ruthless efficiency...and an 
            almost fanatical devotion to the Pope.... Our *four*...no... 
            *Amongst* our weapons.... Amongst our weaponry...are such elements 
            as fear, surprise.... I'll come in again. "
10,Graham Chapman, I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition. 
11,Michael Palin," NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition! Amongst 
            our weaponry are such diverse elements as: fear, surprise, ruthless 
            efficiency, an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope, and nice red 
            uniforms - Oh damn! (To Cardinal Biggles)"
12,Terry Jones, What? 
13,Michael Palin," You'll have to say the bit about 'Our chief 
            weapons are ...' "
14,Terry Jones, 
15,Graham Chapman, I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition. 
16,Terry Jones, Er.... Nobody...um.... 
17,Michael Palin, Expects... 
18,Terry Jones," Expects... Nobody expects the...um...the 
            Spanish...um... "
19,Michael Palin, Inquisition. 
20,Terry Jones," I know, I know! Nobody expects the Spanish 
            Inquisition. In fact, those who do expect - "
21,Michael Palin, Our chief weapons are... 
22,Terry Jones, Our chief weapons are...um...er... 
23,Michael Palin, Surprise... 
24,Terry Jones, Surprise and -- 
25,Michael Palin," Okay, stop. Stop. Stop there - stop there. Stop. 
            Phew! Ah! ...our chief weapons are surprise...blah blah blah. 
            Cardinal, read the charges. "
26,Terry Gilliam," You are hereby charged that you did on diverse dates 
            commit heresy against the Holy Church. 'My old man said follow 
            the...' "
27,Terry Jones, That's enough. 
28,Carol Cleveland, We're innocent. 
29,Michael Palin, Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! 
30,Terry Jones, We'll soon change your mind about that! 
31,Michael Palin," Fear, surprise, and a most ruthless-- "
32,Michael Palin, You....Right! Tie her down. 
33,Michael Palin, Right! How do you plead? 
34,Carol Cleveland, Innocent. 
35,Michael Palin," Ha! Right! Cardinal, give the rack (oh dear)"
36,Terry Jones, I.... 
37,Michael Palin, 
38,Terry Jones, I... 
39,Michael Palin, It makes it all seem so stupid. 
40,Terry Jones, Shall I...? 
41,Michael Palin," No, just pretend for God's sake. Ha! Ha! Ha! "
42,Michael Palin," Now, old woman -- you are accused of heresy on 
            three counts -- heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deed, 
            and heresy by action -- *four* counts. Do you confess? "
43,Marjorie Wilde, I don't understand what I'm accused of. 
44,Michael Palin," Ha! Then we'll make you understand! Biggles! 
            Fetch...THE CUSHIONS! "
45,Terry Jones," Here they are, lord. "
46,Michael Palin," Now, old lady -- you have one last chance. 
            Confess the heinous sin of heresy, reject the works of the ungodly 
            -- *two* last chances. And you shall be free -- *three* last 
            chances. You have three last chances, the nature of which I have 
            divulged in my previous utterance. "
47,Marjorie Wilde, I don't know what you're talking about. 
48,Michael Palin," Right! If that's the way you want it -- Cardinal! 
            Poke her with the soft cushions! "
49,Michael Palin, Confess! Confess! Confess! 
50,Terry Jones," It doesn't seem to be hurting her, lord. "
51,Michael Palin, Have you got all the stuffing up one end? 
52,Terry Jones," Yes, lord. "
53,Michael Palin, 
54,Terry Gilliam, 
55,Michael Palin," So you think you are strong because you can 
            survive the soft cushions. Well, we shall see. Biggles! Put her in 
            the Comfy Chair! "
56,Michael Palin, 
57,Terry Jones," Yes, lord. "
58,Michael Palin," I see. I suppose we make it worse by shouting a 
            lot, do we? Confess, woman. Confess! Confess! Confess! Confess! "
59,Terry Jones, I confess! 
60,Michael Palin, Not you! 
0,John Cleese," Ah, hello, you don't know me, but I'm from the 
            BBC. We were wondering if you'd come and answer the door in a sketch 
            over there, in that sort of direction... You wouldn't have to do 
            anything - just open the door and that's it. "
1,Graham Chapman," Oh, well all right, yes. "
2,John Cleese," Jolly good. Come this way. Cut to film of them 
            coming out of the front door of the house and walking to BBC van. 
            Conversation is heard throughout "
3,John Cleese," Yes, we're on film at the moment you see. "
4,Graham Chapman," It's a link, is it? "
5,John Cleese," Yes that's right, that son of thing, yes, a link. 
            It's all a bit zany - you know a bit madcap funster... frankly I 
            don't fully understand it myself, the kids seem to like it. I much 
            prefer Des O'Connor ... Rolf Harris ... Tom Jones, you know... "
6,Graham Chapman," You do a lot of this sort of thing, do you? "
7,John Cleese," Quite a lot yes, quite a lot. I'm mainly in 
            comedy. I'd like to be in Programming Planning actually, but 
            unfortunately I've got a degree. "
8,Eric Idle," Joke, sir? Guaranteed amusing. As used by the 
            crowned heads of Europe. Has brought tears to the eyes of Royalty.

            Put it on the table. Press the button. It vomits. Absolutely 
            guaranteed. With refills. 'Black soap' - leave it in the bathroom, 
            they wash their hands, real fungus grows on the fingers. Can't get 
            it off for hours. Guaranteed to break the ice at parties. Frighten 
            the elderly - real snakes. Comedy hernia kit. Plastic flesh wounds - 
            just keep your friends in stitches. Guaranteed to break the ice at 
            parties. Hours of fun with 'honeymoon delight' - empty it into their 
            beds - real skunk juice. They won't forget their wedding night. 
            Sticks to the skin, absolutely waterproof, guaranteed to break the 
            ice at parties. Amuse your friends - CS gas canisters - smells, 
            tastes and acts just like the real thing - can blind, maim or kill. 
            Or for drinks, why not buy a 'wicked willy' with a life-size winkle 
            - serves warm beer. Makes real cocktails. Hours of amusement. Or get 
            the new Pooh-Pooh machine. Embarrass your guests - completely 
            authentic sound. Or why not try a new 'naughty nightie' - put it on 
            and it melts - just watch their faces. Guaranteed to break the ice 
            at naughty parties. Go on, go on. "
9,Graham Chapman, What? 
10,Eric Idle, Do the punchline. 
11,Graham Chapman, What punchline? 
12,Eric Idle, The punchline for this bit. 
13,Graham Chapman," I don't know it. They didn't say anything about a 
            punchline. "
14,Eric Idle," Oh! Oh well in that case I'll be saying goodbye 
            then, sir... Goodbye then, sir. "
15,Graham Chapman, What's the punchline? 
16,John Cleese," Punchline? I don't think there's a punchline 
            scheduled, is there? Where are we? A week 39.4 · ·. no, it's Friday, 
            isn't it- 39.7. Oh ... here we are. Oh! "
17,Graham Chapman, Can you give me a lift back? 
18,John Cleese," Ah - can do. But won't. We were wondering if we 
            could possibly borrow your head for a piece of animation. "
19,Graham Chapman, What? 
20,John Cleese," Oh jolly good. Thanks very much. You will get 
            expenses. "
0,John Cleese," Gentlemen, our MP saw the PM this AM and the

            arrangements for the forthcoming annual budgetary period terminating 
            in April. "
1,Graham Chapman, I think he's talking about taxation. 
2,John Cleese," Bravo, Madge. Well done. Taxation is indeed 
            the very hub of my gist. Gentlemen, we have to find something new to 
            tax. "
3,Eric Idle, I understood that. 
4,Terry Jones," If I might put my head on the chopping 
            block so you can kick it around a bit, sir... "
5,John Cleese, Yes? 
6,Terry Jones," Well most things we do for pleasure 
            nowadays are taxed, except one. "
7,John Cleese, What do you mean? 
8,Terry Jones," Well, er, smoking's been taxed, drinking's 
            been taxed but not ... thingy. "
9,John Cleese," Good Lord, you're not suggesting we should 
            tax... thingy? "

11,Terry Jones, No. 
12,Graham Chapman," Thank God for that. Excuse me for a

14,Eric Idle, Number ones? 
15,Terry Jones," No, thingy. "
16,John Cleese, Thingy! 
17,Eric Idle," Ah, thingy. Well it'll certainly make

18,John Cleese, 
19,Terry Jones," To boost the British economy I'd tax 
            all foreigners living abroad. "
20,Eric Idle," I would tax the nude in my bed. No - not tax. 
            What is the word.~ Oh - welcome. "
21,John Cleese," Bring back hanging and go into rope.
            "
22,Michael Palin," I would cut off the more disreputable 
            parts of the body and use the space for playing fields, "
23,Michael Palin, I would tax holiday snaps.

10,Michael Palin," 'Oh Mr. Belpit' - not at all - 'your legs are so 
            swollen'. "
0,Terry Jones," Excuse me, I saw your advertisement for 
            flying lessons and I'd like to make an application. "
1,Carol Cleveland, Appointment? 
2,Terry Jones," Yes, yes. "
3,Carol Cleveland," Certainly. Would you come this way, please. "
4,Carol Cleveland," Morning, Mr. Jones, Mr. Barnes. "
5,Carol Cleveland, Morning Mrs. Wills. 
6,Michael Palin," Morning, luv. "
7,Carol Cleveland, Just follow me. 
8,Terry Jones, Oh thank you. 
9,Carol Cleveland," Oh, be careful. "
10,Terry Jones," Yes, nearly tripped. "
11,Carol Cleveland, Be there soon. 
12,Terry Jones," Good. It's a long way, isn't it? "
13,Carol Cleveland," Oh, get hold of that - watch it. "
14,John Cleese, Morning. 
15,Carol Cleveland," Morning. Upstairs. Be careful, it's 
            very steep. Almost there. "
16,John Cleese, Morning. 
17,Carol Cleveland, Morning. 
18,Terry Jones, Thank you. 
19,Carol Cleveland," Well, Mr. Anemone's on the phone at the 
            moment, but I'm sure he won't mind if you go on in. Through here.
            "
20,Terry Jones, Thank you. 
21,Graham Chapman," Ah, won't be a moment. Make yourself at home.
            "
22,Terry Jones, Chigger. 
23,Graham Chapman," Mr. Chigger. So, you want to learn to fly.
            "
24,Terry Jones, Yes. 
25,Graham Chapman," Right, well, up on the table, arms out, 
            fingers together, knees bent... "
26,Terry Jones," No, no, no. "
27,Graham Chapman, 
28,Terry Jones, Now look here... 
29,Graham Chapman," All right, all right. I'll give you one more 
            chance, get on the table... "
30,Terry Jones," Look, I came here to learn how to fly an 
            aeroplane. "
31,Graham Chapman, A what? 
32,Terry Jones," I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane.
            "
33,Graham Chapman, 
34,Terry Jones," Look. No one in the history of the world has 
            ever been able to fly like that. "
35,Graham Chapman," Oh, I suppose mater told you that while you 
            were out riding. Well, if people can't fly what am I doing up here?
            "
36,Terry Jones, You're on a wire. 
37,Graham Chapman," Oh, a wire. I'm on a wire, am I? "
38,Terry Jones, Of course you're on a bloody wire. 
39,Graham Chapman, I am not on a wire. I am flying. 
40,Terry Jones, You're on a wire. 
41,Graham Chapman, I am flying. 
42,Terry Jones, You're on a wire. 
43,Graham Chapman," I'll show you whether I'm on a wire or not. 
            Give me the 'oop. "
44,Terry Jones, What? 
45,Graham Chapman," Oh, I don't suppose we know what an 'oop is. 
            I suppose pater thought they were a bit common, except on the 
            bleedin' croquet. lawn. "
46,Terry Jones," Oh, a hoop. "
47,Graham Chapman, 'Oh an hoop.' 
48,Terry Jones," Go on, right the way along. "
49,Graham Chapman," All right, all right, all right. "
50,Terry Jones, That hoop's got a hole in. 
51,Graham Chapman," Oh Eton and Madgalene. The hoop has an hole 
            in. Of course it's got a hole in, it wouldn't be a hoop otherwise, 
            would it, mush! "
52,Terry Jones," No, there's a gap in the middle, there. "
53,Graham Chapman," Oh, a gahp. A gahp in one's hhhhhoop. Pardon 
            me, but I'm orf to play the grahnd piano. "
54,Terry Jones," Look, I can see you're on a wire - look, 
            there it is. "
55,Graham Chapman," Look, I told you, you bastard, I'm not on a 
            wire. "
56,Terry Jones, You are. There is. 
57,Graham Chapman, There isn't. 
58,Terry Jones, Is. 
59,Graham Chapman, Isn't! 
60,Terry Jones, Is! 
61,Graham Chapman, Isn't! 
62,Terry Jones, Is! 
63,Graham Chapman, Isn't! 
64,Terry Jones, Is! 
65,Graham Chapman, .Isn't!! 
66,Terry Jones, Is!!! 
67,John Cleese," Anyway, this rather pointless bickering went 
            on for some time until... "
68,Terry Jones," Gosh, I am glad I'm a fully qualified airline 
            pilot. "
69,Eric Idle," The British Airline Pilots Association would 
            like to point out that it takes a chap six years to become a fully 
            qualified airline pilot, and not two. "
70,Eric Idle," Thank you. I didn't want to seem a bit of an 
            old fusspot just now you know, but it's just as easy to get these 
            things right as they are easily found in the BALPA handbook. Oh, one 
            other thing, in the Sherlock Holmes last week Tommy Cooper told a 
            joke about a charter flight, omitting to point out that one must be 
            a member of any organization that charters a plane for at least six 
            months beforehand, before being able to take advantage of it. Did 
            rather spoil the joke for me, I'm afraid. "
71,Graham Chapman, 
72,John Cleese, This is the control cabin. 
73,Graham Chapman," Oh I know. I'm a flying man, you know... oh yes... 
            Bally stupid mistake... "
74,John Cleese, Cloud's heavy ... What's the reading? 
75,Terry Jones, 4.8... Steady. 
76,Graham Chapman," If they had all those dials in the toilet... there 
            wouldn't be room for anything else, would there. "
77,Terry Jones, 
78,Graham Chapman," I wouldn't fancy flying one of those sitting on the 
            toilet... I mean it'd take the glamour out of being a pilot, 
            wouldn't it, ha ha, flying around the world sitting on a toilet. "
79,Terry Jones, Serious? 
80,John Cleese," No, not if it keeps at that level, no. "
81,Graham Chapman," Mind you, if you did fly it from the toilet it 
            would leave a lot more space up here, wouldn't it. "
82,Graham Chapman, Bally piece of luck... 
83,John Cleese," Oh hello. Everything an right at the back?
            "
84,Carol Cleveland," Yes, they're as quiet as dormice. "
85,John Cleese, Dormice? 
0,Michael Palin," All right, don't anybody move ... except to 
            control the aeroplane ... you can move a little to do that. "
1,Carol Cleveland, Can I move? 
2,Michael Palin," Yes, yes, yes. You can move a little bit. Yes. 
            Sorry, I didn't mean to be so dogmatic when I came in. Obviously you 
            can all move a little within reason. There are certain involuntary 
            muscular movements which no amount of self-control can prevent. And 
            obviously any assertion of authority on my part, I've got to take 
            that into account. "
3,John Cleese," Right. I mean one couldn't for example, stop 
            one's insides from moving. "
4,Michael Palin," No, no. Good point, good point. "
5,John Cleese," And the very fact that the plane is 
            continuously vibrating means that we're all moving to a certain 
            extent. "
6,Michael Palin," And we're all moving our lips, aren't we? "
7,John Cleese, Absolutely. 
8,Michael Palin," No, the gist of my meaning was that sudden... 
            er... Hostess Exaggerated movements ... "
9,Michael Palin," Exaggerated violent movements... are... are out.
            "
10,John Cleese," Well, that's the great thing about these 
            modern airliners. I mean, I can keep this plane flying with only the 
            smallest movement and Pancho here doesn't have to move at all. "
11,Michael Palin," Oh, that's marvellous. "
12,Carol Cleveland, 
13,Michael Palin," Well that's wonderful ... 6o% success, eh? "
14,John Cleese," Well, this is a scheduled flight to Cuba.
            "
15,Michael Palin," I know, I know, that's rather why I came in here 
            with that point about nobody moving. "
16,Terry Jones, Within reason. 
17,Michael Palin," Within reason - yes. I... er ... er... you know, I 
            want you to fly this plane to Luton ... please. "
18,John Cleese," Right, well I'd better turn the plane round 
            then. Stand by emergency systems. "
19,Michael Palin," Look I don't want to cause any trouble., "
20,John Cleese," No, no, we'll manage, we'll manage. "
21,Michael Palin," I mean, near Luton will do, you know. Harpenden, 
            do you go near Harpenden? "
22,Terry Jones, It's on the flight path. 
23,Michael Palin," Okay, well, drop me off there. I'll get a bus to 
            Luton. It's only twenty-five minutes. "
24,Carol Cleveland, You can be in Luton by lunchtime. 
25,Michael Palin," Oh, well that's smashing. "
26,Terry Jones, Hang on! There's no airport at Harpenden. 
27,Michael Palin," Oh well, look, forget it. Forget it. I'll come to 
            Cuba, and get a flight back to Luton from there. "
28,John Cleese," Well, we could lend you a parachute. "
29,Michael Palin," No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't dream of it... 
            wouldn't dream of it... dirtying a nice, clean parachute. "
30,Terry Jones," I know - I know. There's a bale of hay 
            outside Basingstoke. We' could throw you out. "
31,Michael Palin," Well, if it's all right. "
32,Michael Palin, Not any trouble? 
33,Michael Palin," That's marvellous. Thank you very much. Sorry to 
            come barging in. "
34,Carol Cleveland, Bye-bye. 
35,Michael Palin, Thank you. Bye. 
36,Michael Palin, 
37,John Cleese, Take this bus to Cuba. 
0,John Cleese," From these glens and scars, the sound of the 
            coot and the moorhen is seldom absent. Nature sits in stern mastery 
            over these rocks and crags. The rush of the mountain stream, the 
            bleat of the sheep, and the broad, clear Highland skies, reflected 
            in turn and 1och ... "
1,John Cleese," But it was with more simple, homespun verses 
            that McTeagle's unique style first flowered. "
2,Terry Jones, 
3,John Cleese," One woman who remembers McTeagle as a young 
            friend - Lassie O'Shen. "
4,Eric Idle," Mr. McTeagle wrote me two poems, between the 
            months of January and April 1969... "
5,Eric Idle," Och, I dinna like to... they were kinda 
            personal... but I will. "
6,John Cleese, 
7,Eric Idle," Can I have £50 to mend the shed? I'm fight on my 
            uppers. I can pay you back When this postal order comes from 
            Australia. Honestly. Hope the bladder trouble's getting better. 
            Love, Ewan. "
8,John Cleese, 
9,Michael Palin," I think what McTcagle's pottery... er... poetry is 
            doing is "
10,Terry Jones, 
11,John Cleese," As a Highlander I would like to complain about 
            some inaccuracies in the preceding film about the poet Ewan McTeagle. 
            Although his name was quite clearly given as McTeagle, he was 
            throughout wearing the Cameron tartan. Also I would like to point 
            out that the BALPA spokesman who complained about aeronautical 
            inaccuracies was himself wearing a captain's hat, whereas he only 
            had lieutenant's stripes on the sleeves of his jacket. Also, in the 
            Inverness pantomime last Christmas, the part of Puss in Boots was 
            played by a native of New Guinea with a plate in her hp, so that 
            every time Dick Whittington gave her a French kiss, he got the back 
            of his throat scraped. "
12,Michael Palin," Look, would you mind going away, I'm trying to 
            examine this man. "
0,Eric Idle," Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake baker's man. Good morning, 
            madam, I'm a psychiatrist. "
1,Graham Chapman, You look like a milkman to me. 
2,Eric Idle, Good. 
3,Graham Chapman, Go away. 
4,Eric Idle," Now then, madam. I'm going to show you three 
            numbers, and I want you to tell me if you see any similarity between 
            them. "
5,Graham Chapman, They're all number three. 
6,Eric Idle, No. Try again. 
7,Graham Chapman, They're all number three? 
8,Eric Idle, No. They're all number three. 
9,Graham Chapman, 
10,Eric Idle, Yogurt? 
11,Graham Chapman, Er... no. 
12,Eric Idle, Cream? 
13,Graham Chapman, No. 
14,Eric Idle, Eggs? 
15,Graham Chapman, No. 
16,Eric Idle, 
17,Graham Chapman, You are a bloody milkman. 
18,Eric Idle," Don't you shout at me, madam, don't come that 
            tone. Now then, I must ask you to accompany me down to the dairy and 
            do some aptitude tests. "
19,Graham Chapman," I've got better things to do than come down to the 
            dairy! "
20,Eric Idle," Mrs. Ratbag, if you don't mind me saying so, you 
            are badly in need of an expensive course of psychiatric treatment. 
            Now I'm not going to say a trip to our dairy will cure you, but it 
            will give hundreds of lower-paid workers a good high. "
21,Graham Chapman, All right... but how am I going to get home? 
22,Eric Idle," I'll. run you there and back on my psychiatrist's 
            float. "
23,Graham Chapman, All right. 
24,Graham Chapman, What are those? 
25,Eric Idle, They're case histories. 
26,Michael Palin," Ah, good morning. I'm afraid our regular 
            psychiatrist hasn't come round this morning ... and I've got an ego 
            block which is in turn making my wife ever-assertive and getting us 
            both into a state of depressive neurosis. "
27,Eric Idle," Oh, I see, sir. Who's your regular, sir? "
28,Michael Palin, Jersey Cream Psychiatrists. 
29,Eric Idle," Oh yes, I know them. "
30,Michael Palin, I'm a doctor. 
31,Eric Idle," ... Didn't I see you just now under a Scotsman? .
            "
32,Michael Palin," Yes, but I am a doctor. Actually, I'm a 
            gynecologist but that was my lunch hour. "
33,Eric Idle, 
34,Michael Palin, Two pints of cream. 
35,Eric Idle," Right... well I should definitely say you're 
            suffering from a severe personality disorder, sir, sublimating 
            itself in a lactic obsession which could get worse depending on how 
            much money you've got. "
36,Michael Palin," Yes, yes, I see. And a pot of yogurt, please. "
37,Eric Idle, 
38,Eric Idle," I feel the time has come to complain about people who 
            make rash complaints without first making sure that those complaints 
            are justified. "
39,Eric Idle," Not necessarily, however, I would like to point out 
            that the BALPA spokesman was wearing the British Psychiatric 
            Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links. "
40,Eric Idle," These are not British Psychiatric Association 
            Dinner Dance Club cuff-links. "
41,Eric Idle, Sorry. 
42,Eric Idle," They are in fact British Sugar Corporation 
            Gilbert-and-Sullivan Society cuff-links. It is in fact a sort of 
            in-joke with us lads here at BALPA. I think the last speaker should 
            have checked his facts before making his own rash complaint. "
43,Eric Idle," However, I would just like to add a complaint 
            about shows that have too many complaints in them as they get very 
            tedious for the average viewer. "
44,Michael Palin," I'd like to complain about people who hold 
            things up by complaining about people complaining. It's about time 
            something was done about it. "
45,Eric Idle," Nurse! Would you take Mrs. Pim to see Dr Cream, 
            please. "
46,Carol Cleveland," Certainly, doctor. Walk this way, please. "
47,Graham Chapman," Oh, if I could walk that way I... "
48,Eric Idle, Sssssh! 
49,Carol Cleveland," Mrs. Pim to see you, Dr Cream. "
50,Carol Cleveland," Yes, doctor. "
0,Michael Palin," Good evening. Tonight on 'It's the Mind', we 
            examine the phenomenon of déjà vu. That strange feeling we sometimes 
            get that we've lived through something before, that what is 
            happening now has already happened. Tonight on 'It's the Mind' we 
            examine the phenomenon of déjà vu, that strange feeling we sometimes 
            get that we've ... (looks puzzled fir a moment) Anyway, tonight on 
            'It's the Mind' we examine the phenomenon of déjà vu, that 
            strange... "
1,Michael Palin," Good evening. Tonight on 'It's the Mind' we 
            examine the phenomenon of déjà vu, that strange feeling we someti... 
            mes get ... that ... we've lived through something... "
2,Michael Palin," Good ... good evening. Tonight on 'It's the 
            Mind' we examine the phenomenon of dddddddddddéjà vvvvvvvvuu, that 
            extraordinary feeling... quite extraordinary... "
3,Eric Idle," Oi, haven't I seen you somewhere before? "
4,Michael Palin," No, doctor, no. Something very funny's happening 
            to me. "
5,Eric Idle," Oi, haven't I seen you somewhere before? "
6,Michael Palin," No, doctor, no. Something very funny's happening 
            to me. The milk float goes past in the background with the milkman 
            and Boniface on it. We see the float go along the country lane past 
            the clearing, past the bishop... "
7,Michael Palin, I have this terrible feeling of déjà vu. 
8,Michael Palin, I have this terrible feeling of déjà vu.. 
9,Michael Palin, I have this terrible feeling of déjà vu.. 
0,John Cleese," The BBC would like to apologize 
            for the next announcement. "
1,Graham Chapman," Gentlemen, we have two basic 
            suggestions for the design of this--"
2,Graham Chapman," Gentlemen, we have two basic 
            suggestions for the design of this--"
3,Graham Chapman," Shut up! Gentlemen, we have two 
            basic suggestions--"
4,Graham Chapman," Gentlemen, we have two basic 
            suggestions for the design of this architectural block, the residential 
            block, and I thought it best that the architects themselves came in to 
            explain the advantages of both designs."
5,John Cleese," Good morning, gentlemen. Uh, 
            this is a twelve-storey block combining classical neo-Georgian features 
            with all the advantages of modern design. Uhh, the tenants arrive in the 
            entrance hall here, are carried along the corridor on a conveyor belt in 
            extreme comfort and past murals depicting Mediterranean scenes, towards 
            the rotating knives. The last twenty feet of the corridor are heavily 
            soundproofed. The blood pours down these chutes and the mangled flesh 
            slurps into these large containers--"
6,Michael Palin, Excuse me.
7,John Cleese, Hmm?
8,Michael Palin," Uh, did you say 'knives'?"
9,John Cleese," Uh, rotating knives. Yes."
10,Terry Jones," Are you, uh, proposing to 
            slaughter our tenants?"
11,John Cleese," Does that not fit in with your 
            plans?"
12,Michael Palin," No, it does not. Uh, we-- we 
            wanted a... simple... block of flats."
13,John Cleese," Ahh, I see. I hadn't, uh, 
            correctly divined your attitude..."
14,Michael Palin," Uh, huh huh."
15,John Cleese, ...towards your tenants.
16,Michael Palin, Huh huh.
17,John Cleese," You see, I mainly design 
            slaughter houses."
18,Michael Palin, Yes. Pity.
19,John Cleese," Mind you, this is a real beaut. 
            I mean, none of your blood caked on the walls and flesh flying out of 
            the windows inconveniencing passers-by with this one. I mean, my life 
            has been building up to this."
20,Terry Jones," Yes, and well done, huh, but 
            we did want a block of flats."
21,John Cleese," Well, may I ask you to 
            reconsider? I mean, you wouldn't regret it. Think of the tourist trade."
22,Michael Palin," No, no, it's-- it's just that 
            we wanted a block of flats and not an abattoir. "
23,John Cleese," Yes, well, that's the sort of 
            blinkered, philistine pig ignorance I've come to expect from you 
            non-creative garbage. You sit there on your loathsome, spotty behinds 
            squeezing blackheads, not caring a tinker's cuss for the struggling 
            artist. You excrement! You whining, hypocritical toadies, with your 
            color TV sets and your Tony Jacklin golf clubs and your bleeding Masonic 
            secret handshakes! You wouldn't let me join, would you, you blackballing 
            bastards! Well, I wouldn't become a freemason now if you went down on 
            your lousy, stinking knees and begged me!"
24,Terry Jones," Well, we're sorry you feel 
            like that, but we, um, did... want... a block of flats. Nice, though, 
            the abattoir is. Huh huh."
25,John Cleese," Oh, p-p-p-p the abattoir."
26,Michael Palin, Thank you.
27,John Cleese, I've got a second-hand apron.
28,Terry Jones, Thank you.
29,John Cleese, I nearly got in at Hendon.
30,Michael Palin, Thank you.
31,Graham Chapman," I'm sorry about that, gentlemen. 
            The second architect is Mr. Leavey of Wymis and Dibble."
32,Eric Idle," Good morning, gentlemen."
33,Eric Idle," Uhh, this is a scale model of 
            the block. Uh, there are twenty-eight stories with two hundred and 
            eighty modern apartments. There are three main lifts and two service 
            lifts. Access would be from Dibbingley Road."
34,Terry Jones," Isn't that going to put the 
            cost up?"
35,Eric Idle," Uh, it might."
36,Terry Jones," Well, I don't know whether 
            I'd worry about strengthening that much. After all, they're not meant to 
            be luxury flats. Huh."
37,Michael Palin," No, I quite agree. I mean, 
            providing the tenants are of light build and relatively sedentary and, 
            uhh, (er instead) given a spot of good weather, I think we're on to a 
            winner here."
38,Terry Jones, Yes.
39,Eric Idle," Uh, thank you."
40,Terry Jones, I quite agree. I quite agree.
41,Eric Idle, Thank you very much. Thank you.
42,John Cleese," It opens doors, I'm telling 
            you."
0,Eric Idle," What other ways are there of recognizing 
            a mason?"
1,John Cleese," Having once identified a mason 
            immediate steps must be taken to isolate him from the general 
            public. Having accomplished that it is now possible to cure him of 
            these unfortunate Masonic tendencies through the use of behavioral 
            psychotherapy. "
2,John Cleese," No?! That's wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! 
            Wrong! No! No! Bad!..."
0,Michael Palin, What do you want? 
1,Graham Chapman," Well I've come about your special fully comprehensive 
            motor insurance policy offer... "
2,Michael Palin, What was that? 
3,Graham Chapman," Fully comprehensive motor insurance for one-and-eight 
            pence. "
4,Michael Palin," Oh, oh, yes ... yeah well, unfortunately, guv, 
            that offer's no longer valid. You see, it turned out not to be 
            economically viable, so we now have a totally new offer... "
5,Graham Chapman, What's that? 
6,Michael Palin, A nude lady. 
7,Graham Chapman, A nude lady? 
8,Michael Palin," Yes. You get a nude lady with a fully 
            comprehensive motor insurance. If you just want third party she has 
            to keep her bra on, and if it's just theft... "
9,Graham Chapman," No, no, I don't really want that, Mr. er... Mr... "
10,Michael Palin, Devious. 
11,Graham Chapman," Mr. Devious, I just want to know what it would cost 
            me to have a fully comprehensive insurance on a 1970 Aston Martin,
            "
12,Michael Palin, Aston Martin? 
13,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
14,Michael Palin, 
15,Graham Chapman, Five hundred quid? 
16,Michael Palin, Forty quid. 
17,Graham Chapman, Forty quid? 
18,Michael Palin, Forty quid and a nude lady. 
19,Graham Chapman," No, no, I'm not interested in a nude lady. "
20,Michael Palin, Dirty books? 
21,Graham Chapman," No, no, look, I'm not interested in any of that. I 
            just want to know what it would cost me to have a fully 
            comprehensive insurance on a 1970 Aston Martin. Can you please quote 
            me your price. "
22,Eric Idle, Knock knock. 
23,Michael Palin, Who's there? 
24,Eric Idle, The Reverend... 
25,Michael Palin, The Reverend who? 
26,Eric Idle, The Reverend Morrison. 
27,Michael Palin," Oh, come in. "
28,Michael Palin," Now then, vic. What's the trouble? "
29,Eric Idle," Well, it's about this letter you sent me. "
30,Graham Chapman," Excuse me, do I have any more lines? "
31,Michael Palin," I don't know, mush, I'll have a look in the 
            script... "
32,Graham Chapman, Yeah. 
33,Michael Palin," No... no, you've finished. "
34,Graham Chapman," Well, I'll be off then. "
35,Michael Palin, 
36,Eric Idle," It's about this letter you sent me regarding my 
            insurance claim. "
37,Michael Palin," Oh, yeah, yeah - well, you see, it's just that 
            we're not... as yet ... totally satisfied with the grounds of your 
            claim. "
38,Eric Idle," But it says something about filling my mouth in 
            with cement. "
39,Michael Palin," Oh well, that's just insurance jargon, you know.
            "
40,Eric Idle," But my car was hit by a lorry while standing in the 
            garage and you refuse to pay my claim. "
41,Michael Palin, 
42,Eric Idle, Oh dear. 
43,Michael Palin," You see, you unfortunately plumped for our 'Neverpay' 
            policy, which, you know, if you never claim is very worthwhile ... 
            but you had to claim, and, well, there it is. "
44,Eric Idle," Oh dear, oh dear. "
45,Michael Palin," Still, never mind - could be worse. How's the 
            nude lady? "
46,Eric Idle," Oh, she's fine. "
47,Michael Palin," Look... Rev... I hate to see a man cry, so shove 
            off out 't office. There's a good chap. "
48,Terry Jones," OK, Devious... Don't move! "
49,Michael Palin, The bishop! 
0,Michael Palin, The bishop! 
1,Graham Chapman, I take as my text for today... 
2,Terry Jones," The text, Vic! Don't say the text! "
3,Graham Chapman, Leviticus 3-14. . . 
4,Terry Jones," We was too late. The Reverend Grundy bit the 
            ceiling. "
5,Terry Jones, Hello? '... What?... We'll be right over! 
6,Graham Chapman," And it is for this reason that the Christian 
            Church lays upon you, the godparents, the obligation of seeing this 
            child is brought up in the Christian faith. Therefore, I name this 
            child... "
7,Terry Jones," Don't say the kid's name, Vic! "
8,Graham Chapman, Francesco Luigi... 
9,Terry Jones," We was too late... The Rev. Neuk saw the light.
            "
10,Terry Jones," The ring, Vic Don't touch the ring! Hey Vic! "
11,John Cleese," ... dust to dust, ashes to ashes. "
12,Eric Idle," Help ... help... help... help... help... 
            help... "
13,Terry Jones," OK, Devious, don't move! "
14,Michael Palin, The bishop! 
0,Graham Chapman, 
1,Michael Palin, 
2,Graham Chapman, No. 
3,Eric Idle," These two old people are typical of the 
            housing problem facing Britain's aged. "
4,Graham Chapman," Here! Don't you start doing a documentary on 
            us, young man. "
5,Eric Idle, Oh please ... 
6,Graham Chapman," No, you leave us alone! "
7,Eric Idle," Oh, just a little one about the appalling 
            conditions under which you live. "
8,Graham Chapman, No! Get out of our house! Go on! 
9,Graham Chapman," Why don't you do a documentary about the drug 
            problem round in Walton Street? "
10,Graham Chapman," Oh, I'll go and have a bath. "
0,Graham Chapman," 'Ere, there's Alfred Lord Tennyson in the 
            bathroom. "
1,Michael Palin," Well, at least the poet's been installed, 
            then. "
2,John Cleese," Yes, a poet is essential for complete home 
            comfort, and all-year round reliability at low cost. We in the East 
            Midlands Poet Board hope to have a poet in every home by the end of 
            next year. "
3,Eric Idle, 
4,Eric Idle," I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high...
            "
5,Michael Palin," Morning, madam, I've come to read your poet.
            "
6,Terry Jones," Oh yes, he's in the cupboard under the stairs. "
7,Michael Palin," What is it, a Swinburne? Shelley? "
8,Terry Jones," No, it's a Wordsworth. "
9,Michael Palin," Oh, bloody daffodils. "
10,Eric Idle," A host of golden daffodils Beside the lake, 
            beneath the' trees Fluttering and dancing in the breeze "
11,Eric Idle," Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle 
            in the Milky Way They stretch in... "
12,Michael Palin," Right. Thank you, madam. "
13,Terry Jones," Oh, not at all. Thank you... It's a nice day, isn't 
            it? "
14,Michael Palin," Yes, yes, the weather situation is generally 
            favorable. There's a ridge of high pressure centered over Ireland 
            which is moving steadily eastward bringing cloudy weather to parts 
            of the West Country, Wales and areas west of the Pennines. On 
            tomorrow's chart ... "
15,Eric Idle," Now on BBC television a choice of 
            viewing. On BBC 2 - a discussion on censorship between Derek Hart, 
            The Bishop of Woolwich and a nude man. And on BBC 1 - me telling you 
            this. And now... "
16,Terry Jones," We don't want that, do we. Do you really want that 
            cherry in your tea? Do you like doing this job? "
17,Michael Palin," Well, it's a living, isn't it? "
18,Terry Jones," I mean, don't you get bored reading people's poets 
            all day? "
19,Michael Palin," Well, you know, sometimes ... yeah. Anyway, I 
            think I'd better be going. "
20,Terry Jones, 
21,Michael Palin, 
22,Terry Jones, 
23,Michael Palin," Er ... um... well, I'll have a look at the 
            batteries. "
24,Terry Jones," Oh yes, yes. "
25,Michael Palin, It's four and a half volts. 
26,Terry Jones, 
27,Michael Palin," No, no, I must be off, really. "
28,Terry Jones," I've got Thomas Hardy in the bedroom. I'd like you to 
            look at him. "
29,Michael Palin," Ah well, I can't touch him. He's a novelist.
            "
30,Terry Jones," Oh, he keeps mumbling all night. "
31,Michael Palin," Oh well, novelists do, you see. "
32,Terry Jones, 
33,Michael Palin, Harness. 
34,Terry Jones," No, no! Your first name, silly! "
35,Michael Palin, Wombat. 
36,Terry Jones," Oh, Wombat. Wombat Harness! Take me to the place 
            where eternity knows no bounds, where the garden of love encloses us 
            round. Oh Harness! "
37,Michael Palin," All right, I'll have a quick look at yer Thomas 
            Hardy. "
38,John Cleese," Nude man, what did you make of that? "
39,Graham Chapman," Well, don't you see, that was exactly the kind 
            of explicit sexual reference I'm objecting to. It's titillation for 
            the sake of it. A deliberate attempt at cheap sensationalism. I 
            don't care what the so-called avant-garde, left-wing, intellectual 
            namby-pambies say... It is filth! "
40,John Cleese, Bishop. 
41,Eric Idle," The BBC would like to apologize for the 
            constant repetition in this show. "
42,Eric Idle," The BBC would like to apologize for the 
            constant repetition in this show."
0,John Cleese," (JOHN) Right. I've got some of your prescriptions 
            here. Er, who's got the pox? "
1,Eric Idle," The BBC would like to apologize for the poor 
            quality of the writing in that sketch. It is not BBC policy to get 
            easy laughs with words like bum, knickers, bony or wee-wees. "
2,Michael Palin," These are the words that are not to be used again 
            on this program. "
3,Michael Palin, (pointing) Out! 
4,John Cleese," Right, who's got a boil on his Semprini, then? "
0,Eric Idle, Good morning. 
1,Michael Palin," Good morning, sir. "
2,Eric Idle," Good morning. I'd like some aftershave, please. "
3,Michael Palin," Ah, certainly. Walk this way, please. "
4,Eric Idle," If I could walk that way I wouldn't need aftershave.
            "
5,Eric Idle, Good morning. 
6,Michael Palin, 
7,Eric Idle, Yes. I'd like some aftershave. 
8,Michael Palin," Ah. A toilet requisite-t-t-t-t-t... Would you 
            like to try this, sir. It's our very very latest, it's called Sea 
            Mist. "
9,Eric Idle, 
10,Michael Palin," How about something a little more musky? This 
            one's called Mimmo. "
11,Eric Idle," Not really, no. Have you anything a little more 
            fishier? "
12,Michael Palin, Fishier? 
13,Eric Idle, Fishier. 
14,Michael Palin," Fish, fish, fish. A fishy requisite-t-t-t-t-t...
            "
15,Eric Idle, Like halibut or sea bass. 
16,Michael Palin, Or bream? 
17,Eric Idle, Yes. 
18,Michael Palin," No, we haven't got any of that... ah, I've got 
            mackerel... or cod... or hake... "
19,Eric Idle," You haven't got anything a little more halibutish?
            "
20,Michael Palin," Er... parrot? What's that doing there? Or skate 
            with just a hint of prawn? Or crab, tiger and almonds, very unusual.
            "
21,Eric Idle, I really had my heart set on halibut. 
22,Michael Palin," Well, sir, we had a fishy consignment in this 
            morning, so I could nip down to the basement and see if I can come 
            up trumps on this particular requisite-t-t-t-t-t. So it was 
            halibut... or... ? "
23,Eric Idle, Sea bass. 
24,Michael Palin, Sea bass. Won't be a moment. 
25,Eric Idle, 
26,Michael Palin," Well, sorry, sir. "
27,Eric Idle, How long will that be? 
28,Michael Palin, Twenty minutes. 
29,Eric Idle, Twenty minutes! 
30,Eric Idle," Oh... I wonder what other people use for aftershave 
            lotion? "
31,Michael Palin," I use a body rub called Halitosis to make my 
            breath seem sweet. "
32,John Cleese, I use an aftershave called Semprini. 
33,Michael Palin, 
34,Michael Palin," I use two kinds of aftershave lotions - 
            Frankincense, Myrrh - three kinds of aftershave lotions, 
            Frankincense, Myrrh, Sandalwood - four kinds of aftershave lotion. 
            Frankincense, .... "
35,Graham Chapman," I have a cold shower every morning just 
            before I go mad, and then I go mad, 1. Mad, 2. Mad, 3. Mad, 4... "
36,Michael Palin," I use Rancid Polecat number two. It keeps my skin 
            nice and scaly. "
37,Michael Palin, 
38,Michael Palin," Well I'm afraid they don't have any at our 
            Kensington branch. But we have some down at the depot. "
39,Eric Idle, Where's that? 
40,Michael Palin, Aberdeen. 
41,Eric Idle, Aberdeen? 
42,Michael Palin, It's all fight. Wait here ... I've got a car. 
43,Eric Idle," No, no, no. I'll take the other, the crab, tiger 
            and... "
44,Michael Palin, Almond requisite... t... t... ? 
45,Eric Idle, I'll take it. 
0,Graham Chapman," Right. Right! RIGHT! Now then! Now then! Your 
            turn. "
1,Michael Palin," Aren't you going to say 'What's all this then?'?
            "
2,Graham Chapman," Oh! Right, what's all this, then? "
3,Michael Palin," This man has been shoplifting, officer. "
4,Graham Chapman," Oh, he has? Yes? "
5,Michael Palin, Yes. 
6,Graham Chapman, Are you trying to tell me my job? 
7,Michael Palin," No, but he's been shoplifting. "
8,Graham Chapman," Look! I must warn you that anything you may say 
            will be ignored and furthermore, given half a chance I'll put my 
            fist through your teeth. F'tang. F'tang. "
9,Graham Chapman," But officer, this man here... "
10,Graham Chapman," I've had enough of you. You're under arrest.
            "
11,Michael Palin," Officer, it wasn't him. "
12,Terry Gilliam, No I'm not. 
13,Terry Gilliam," (sticking his head out of mac) He's not 
            ... I'm a witness. "
14,Graham Chapman, 
15,Michael Palin," Heresy. Blimey. I didn't expect the Spanish 
            Inquisition. "
16,Graham Chapman," Shut up! F'tang. F'tang. Oh, that's nice. "
17,Graham Chapman, What for? 
18,Graham Chapman," I'm charging you with illegal possession of 
            whatever we happen to have down there. Right. "
19,John Cleese," (JOHN) The BBC would like to apologize to the 
            police about the character of Police Constable Pan Am. He was not 
            meant to represent the average police officer. Similarly, the 
            reference to Buzz Aldrin, the astronaut, was the product of a 
            disordered mind and should not be construed as having any other 
            significance. Photo of Buzz Aldrin. "
0,Michael Palin," Monty Python's Flying Circus tonight comes to 
            you live from the Grillomat Snack Bar, Paignton. "
1,John Cleese," Hello to you live from the Grillomat Snack Bar, 
            Paignton. And so, without any more ado, let's have the titles. "

0,Eric Idle," Gentlemen, pray silence for the President of 
            the Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things. "
1,Graham Chapman," I thank you, gentlemen. The year has been a 
            good one for the Society "
2,John Cleese," Er, Cutler, Staffordshire. Um ... well, Mr. 
            Chairman, it's just that most of the members in Staffordshire 
            feel... the whole thing's a bit silly. "
3,Graham Chapman, Silly SILLY!! 
4,Graham Chapman," Good Lord. I'm on film. How did that happen?
            "
5,Graham Chapman, It's film again. What's going on? 
6,Graham Chapman," Gentlemen! I have bad news. This room is 
            surrounded by film. "
7,Graham Chapman," Don't panic, we'll get out of this. "
8,Graham Chapman, We'll tunnel our way out. 
9,Michael Palin," Good thinking, sir. I'll get the horse. "
10,Graham Chapman," Okay Captain, you detail three men, start 
            digging and load them up with cutlery, and then we'll have a rota, 
            we'll have two hours digging, two hours vaulting and then two hours 
            sleeping, okay? "
11,John Cleese," All right, Medwin, lees see you get over that 
            horse. Pick your feet up, Medwin. Come on, boy! "
12,Terry Jones, 
13,John Cleese," Colonel! I've just found another exit, sir.
            "
14,Graham Chapman," Okay, quickly, run this way. "
15,John Cleese," Ah, hello. Well they certainly seem to be in a 
            tight spot, and I spot... our next item - so let's get straight on 
            with the fun and go over to the next item - or dish! Ha, ha!"
0,John Cleese," Hello. 'Ow are you? I'm fine. Welcome to a new 
            half-hour chat show in which me, viz the man what's talking to you 
            now, and Brooky - to wit my flat mate - and nothing else, I'd like 
            to emphasize that - discuss current affairs issues of burning 
            import. "
1,Eric Idle," Have you heard the one about the three nuns in the 
            nudist colony? "
2,John Cleese," Shut up. Tonight, the population explosion. "
3,Eric Idle, Apparently there were these three nuns... 
4,John Cleese," Shut up. Come the year 1991, given the present 
            rate of increase in the world's population, the Chinese will be 
            three deep. Another thing... "
5,Terry Jones," Sorry, loves, sorry, the show is too long 
            this week and this scene's been cut. "
6,John Cleese, Lord Hill's at the bottom Of this. 
7,Terry Jones," But if you can find a piano stool you can 
            appear later on in the show on film. "
8,Eric Idle, 'Ow much? 
9,Terry Jones," Oh, about ten bob each. "
10,John Cleese, I wouldn't wipe me nose on it. 
11,Eric Idle," 'Ave you 'eard the one about these three nuns...
            "
12,John Cleese," Sh. I can hear something. 'Ang about, we may 
            still get in this show as a link. "
13,Eric Idle, That's clever. How do they do that? 
14,John Cleese," color separation, you cotton head."
0,Graham Chapman," Well, if you'll just wait in here, sir, I'm sure 
            Mr. Thompson won't keep you waiting long. "
1,Eric Idle," Fine. Thanks very much. He picks up a magazine. The 
            mirror behind him without warning falls off the wall and smashes to 
            the ground. The butler returns, and looks at the man enquiringly.
            "
2,Eric Idle, The mirror fell off the wall. 
3,Graham Chapman, Sir? 
4,Eric Idle, The mirror fell off... off the wall... it fell. 
5,Graham Chapman, 
6,Eric Idle," Ah, it ... it came off the wall. "
7,Graham Chapman," Yes, sir? "
8,Eric Idle, It just came right off the wall. 
9,Graham Chapman," Really, sir. "
10,Eric Idle," Yes, I ... I didn't touch it. "
11,Graham Chapman, 
12,Eric Idle, Yes. It just fell off the wall. 
13,Graham Chapman, Don't move. I'll get help. 
14,Eric Idle," Yes - er, fell off the wall. "
15,Carol Cleveland," Oh my God, what a mess. 'Ere, did you do this? "
16,Eric Idle," No, no. I didn't do all this. It... it did it all.
            "
17,Carol Cleveland," Oh? Well... 'ere, hold this. I'll get started. "
18,Eric Idle," Oh, it's jolly nice. What is it? "
19,Carol Cleveland, It's a Brazilian dagger. Ooops. 
20,Eric Idle," Er, she just fell on ... on to the dagger. "
21,Terry Jones, 
22,Eric Idle," Yes, just gave me the dagger and tripped, and went, 
            'Oops'. "
23,Terry Jones," Yes sir, I understand. "
24,Eric Idle," I mean, I didn't er... "
25,Terry Jones," Oh no, no, of course not, sir, I understand. "
26,Eric Idle," I mean she ... she just, er... "
27,Terry Jones, Fell? 
28,Eric Idle, Fell. 
29,Terry Jones, 
30,Eric Idle, 
31,Graham Chapman, That's him. 
32,Michael Palin," Right, sir. "
33,Eric Idle," Hello, officer. There seems to have been an accident. 
            Well, several accidents actually. "
34,Michael Palin," That's right, sir. Would you come this way, 
            please. "
35,Graham Chapman, You swine. I'll get you for that. 
36,Eric Idle," Er, I won't wait. I'll phone. "
37,Eric Idle, Sorry.
0,Graham Chapman," 'Tis time the seven Smith brothers had brides. 
            Fetch me Smith Major. "
1,Terry Jones, Sir. 
2,Graham Chapman," 'Tis time you and your six brothers were 
            married. "
3,Terry Jones," Thank you, Headmaster. "
4,Graham Chapman," Fetch me your six brothers, that the seven 
            brothers may be together. "
5,Graham Chapman," Right, I'll see Watson, Wilkins, and Spratt in 
            my study afterwards. "
6,Terry Jones, 
7,Terry Gilliam, The Sabine School for Girls. 
8,Eric Idle," Yes, and it's the Annual Dance. "
9,Graham Chapman," Fetch hither the seven brides for seven 
            brothers. "
10,Graham Chapman," Fetch hither the padre that the seven brides 
            may marry the seven brothers. "
11,Michael Palin, 
12,Graham Chapman," What you do in your own time, Padre, is 
            written on the wall in the vestry. "
13,Michael Palin," Right, do you four boys take these two girls to be 
            your seven brides? "
14,Michael Palin," Right, go and do your prep. "
0,Michael Palin," Good morning, I'd care to purchase a chicken, 
            please. "
1,Eric Idle," Don't come here with that posh talk you nasty, 
            stuck-up twit. "
2,Michael Palin, I beg your pardon? 
3,Eric Idle," A chicken, sir. Certainly. "
4,Michael Palin," Thank you. And how much does that work out to per 
            pound, my good fellow? "
5,Eric Idle," Per pound, you slimy Trollope, what kind of a 
            ponce are you? "
6,Michael Palin, I'm sorry? 
7,Eric Idle," 4/6 a pound, sir, nice and ready for roasting.
            "
8,Michael Palin," I see, and I'd care to purchase some stuffing in 
            addition, please. "
9,Eric Idle," Use your own, you great poofy poonagger! "
10,Michael Palin, What? 
11,Eric Idle," Ah, certainly sir, some stuffing. "
12,Michael Palin," Oh, thank you. "
13,Eric Idle," 'Oh, thank you' says the great queen like a 
            la-di-dah poofta. "
14,Michael Palin, I beg your pardon? 
15,Eric Idle," That's all right, sir, call again. "
16,Michael Palin, Excuse me. 
17,Eric Idle," What is it now, you great pillock? "
18,Michael Palin," Well, I can't help noticing that you insult me and 
            then you're polite to me alternately. "
19,Eric Idle," I'm terribly sorry to hear that, sir. "
20,Michael Palin, That's all right. It doesn't really matter. 
21,Eric Idle," Tough titty if it did, you nasty spotted prancer.
            "
0,Michael Palin," (MICHAEL) This is Ken Clean-air Systems, the 
            great white hope of the British boxing world. After three fights - 
            and only two convictions - his manager believes that Ken is ready to 
            face the giant American, Satellite Five. "
1,Graham Chapman," The great thing about Ken is that he's almost 
            totally stupid. "
2,Michael Palin," Every morning, he jogs the forty-seven miles 
            from his two-bedroomed, eight-bathroom, six-up-two-down, 
            three-to-go-house in Reigate, to the Government's Pesticide Research 
            Centre at Shoreham. Nobody knows why. "
3,Eric Idle," Basically Ken is a very gentle, 
            home-loving person. I remember when one of his stick insects had a 
            knee infection. He stayed up all night rubbing it with germoline and 
            banging its head on the table. "
4,Terry Jones," Oh he was such a pretty baby, always so kind and 
            gentle. He was really considerate to his mother, and not at all the 
            kind of person you'd expect to pulverize their opponent into a 
            bloody mass of flesh and raw bone, spitting teeth and fragments of 
            gum into a ring which had become one man's hell and Ken's glory. "
5,Michael Palin," Every morning at his little three-room semi 
            near Reading Ken gets up at three o'clock "
6,Michael Palin," At seven o'clock Ken gets up, he has a quick 
            shower, a rub-down, gets into his track-suit, and goes back to bed 
            again. "
7,Michael Palin," I used to wake Ken up with a crowbar on the back 
            of the head. But I recently found that this was too far from his 
            brain and I wasn't getting through to him anymore. So I now wake him 
            up with a steel peg driven into his skull with a mallet. "
8,Michael Palin," For breakfast every day, Ken places a plate of 
            liver and bacon under his chair, and locks himself in the cupboard.
            "
9,Graham Chapman," Well, he's having a lot of mental difficulties 
            with his breakfasts, but this is temperament, caused by a small 
            particle of brain in his skull, and once we've removed that he'll be 
            perfectly all right. "
10,Michael Palin, At 8.30 the real training begins. 
11,Michael Palin," For lunch Ken crouches down in the road and 
            rubs gravel into his hair. "
12,Michael Palin," Hello. When Ken is in a really deep sleep like 
            this one, the only way to wake him up is to saw his head off. "
13,Michael Palin," What is he like in the ring, this human 
            dynamo, this eighteen-stone bantam weight battering-ram? We asked 
            his sparring partner and one-time childhood sweetheart, Maureen 
            Spencer. "
14,Carol Cleveland," Well, I think that if Ken keeps his right up, 
            gets in with the left jab and takes the fight to his man - well, he 
            should go for a cut eye in the third and put Wilcox on the canvas by 
            six. "
15,Michael Palin," Ken's opponent in Tuesday's fight is Petula 
            Wilcox, the Birmingham girl who was a shorthand typist before 
            turning pro in 1968. "
16,Connie Booth," Well, I'm a southpaw and I think this will confuse 
            him, particularly with his brain problem. "
17,John Cleese," I think boxin's a splendid sport - teaches 
            you self-defense. "
18,Terry Jones," Obviously boxing must have its limits, but 
            providing they're both perfectly fit I can see nothing wrong with 
            one healthy man heating the bring daylights out of a little 
            schoolgirl. "
19,Michael Palin, It's quick and it's fun. 
0,John Cleese," You probably noticed that I didn't say 'and now 
            for something completely different' just now. This is simply because 
            I am unable to appear in the show this week. "
1,Terry Jones," I'm terribly sorry to interrupt but my tooth's 
            hurting, just around here. "
2,Michael Palin, Get off. 
3,Terry Jones," Oh, sorry. "
4,Graham Chapman," I'm not sorry to interrupt - I'll interrupt 
            anything if it gets people looking in my direction - like at my old 
            school where, by a coincidence, the annual prize giving is going on 
            at this very moment. "
0,Graham Chapman," Velly solly for hold-up ... no ploblem now ... 
            me are Bishop of East Anglia, now piesent plizes ... Eyes down for 
            first plize ... The Fyffe-Chulmleigh Spoon for Latin Elegaics... 
            'goes to ... People's Republic of China! Aaaagh! "
1,Terry Jones," Good evening, everybody. My name's Bradshaw- 
            Inspector Elizabeth Bradshaw, of the Special Branch Speech Day 
            Squad, but I'd like you to think of me as the Bishop of East Anglia, 
            and I'd like to present the first prize, the Grimwade Gynn Trophy 
            to... "
2,John Cleese, 
0,Graham Chapman, Mr. L.F. Dibley's latest film 'if'. 
1,Terry Jones," Oh yes, well, I mean, there were some people who 
            said my film '2001 - A Space Odyssey', was similar to Stanley 
            Kubrick's. I mean, that's the sort of petty critical niggling that's 
            dogged my career. It makes me sick. I mean, as soon as I'd made 
            'Midnight Cowboy' with the vicar as Ratso Rizzo, John Schlesinger 
            rushes out his version, and gets it premiered while mine's still at 
            the chemist's. "
2,Graham Chapman," Well, we have with us tonight one of your 
            films, 'Rear Window', which was to become such a success for Alfred 
            Hitchcock a few weeks later. Now this is a silent film, so perhaps 
            you could talk us through it... "
3,Terry Jones," Yes, well, let's see now ... there's the rear 
            window. There's the man looking out of the window. He sees the 
            murder. The murderer's come into the room to kill him, but he's 
            outwitted him and he's all right. The End. I mean, Alfred Hitchcock, 
            who's supposed to be so bloody wonderful, padded that out to one and 
            a half hours ... lost all the tension ... just because he had bloody 
            Grace Kelly he made £3 million more than I did. Mind you, at least 
            she can act a bit, I could have done with her in 'Finian's Rainbow' 
            ... The man from the off-license was terrible ... a real failure 
            that was - ten seconds of solid boredom. "
4,Terry Jones, Bloody terrible.
0,Graham Chapman," Mr. L. F. Dibley's 'Finian's Rainbow'. And 
            now over to me. "
1,Graham Chapman," That gives you just some idea of what's going 
            on out there. Today saw the long-awaited publication of the Portman 
            Committee's Report on Industrial Reorganization..."
2,Graham Chapman," It's taken five years to prepare and it's 
            bound to have an enormous impact on the future of industrial 
            relations in this country. In the studio tonight Lord Porlman, 
            Chairman of the Committee, Sir Charles Avery, Employers' 
            Reorganization Council, and Ray Millichope, leader of the Allied 
            Technicians' Union. And they're going to make a human pyramid."
3,Graham Chapman," .Bra... vo. Now the President of the Board of 
            Trade..."
4,Graham Chapman, Now here's the Vice-Chairman of ICI.
5,Graham Chapman," Well, so much for politics and the problems 
            of Britain's industrial reorganization. Now we turn to the higher 
            subject of sport, and Reg Harris, the former world cycling sprint 
            champion, talks to us about the psychological problems of big race 
            preparation. "
6,Michael Palin," Who shall declare this good, that ill"
0,Rita Davies," We had the most marvelous holiday. It was 
            absolutely fantastic. "
1,Michael Palin, Absolutely wonderful. 
2,Rita Davies," Michael, you tell them about it. "
3,Michael Palin," No, darling, you tell them. "
4,Rita Davies, You do it so much better. 
5,Michael Palin, Excuse me a moment. 
6,John Cleese," Dung, sir. "
7,Michael Palin, What? 
8,John Cleese, We've got your dung. 
9,Michael Palin, What dung? 
10,John Cleese," Your dung. Three hundredweight of heavy droppings. 
            Where do you want it? "
11,Michael Palin, I didn't order any dung. 
12,John Cleese," Yes you did, sir. You ordered it through the Book of 
            the Month Club. "
13,Michael Palin, Book of the Month Club? 
14,John Cleese," That's fight, sir. You get 'Gone with the Wind', 'Les 
            Miserables' by Victor Hugo, 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' and with 
            every third book you get dung. "
15,Michael Palin, I didn't know that when I signed the form. 
16,John Cleese," Well, no, no. It wasn't on the form - they found it 
            wasn't good for business. Anyway, we've got three hundredweight of 
            dung in the van. Where do you want it? "
17,Michael Palin," Well, I don't think we do. We've no garden. "
18,John Cleese," Well, it'll all fit in here - it's top-class 
            excrement. "
19,Michael Palin," You can't put it in here, we've having a dinner 
            party! "
20,John Cleese, 'Salright. I'll put it on the telly. 
21,Michael Palin," Darling... there's a man here with our Book of the 
            Month Club dung. "
22,Rita Davies," We've no room, dear. "
23,John Cleese," Well, how many rooms have you got, then? "
24,Michael Palin," Well, there's only this room, the bedroom, a spare 
            room. "
25,John Cleese," Oh well, I'll tell you what, move everything into the 
            main bedroom, then you can use the spare room as a dung room. "
26,Michael Palin, Yes. 
27,Graham Chapman, Dead Indian. 
28,Michael Palin, What? 
29,Graham Chapman," Have you recently bought a new cooker, sir? "
30,Michael Palin, Yes. 
31,Graham Chapman," Ah well, this is your free dead Indian, as 
            advertised... "
32,Michael Palin, I didn't see that in the adverts... 
33,Graham Chapman," No, it's in the very small print, you see, sir, 
            so as not to affect the sales. "
34,Michael Palin, We've no room. 
35,John Cleese," That's all right - you can put the dead Indian in the 
            spare room on top of the dung. "
36,Michael Palin, He's not dead! 
37,Graham Chapman," Oh well, that's probably a faulty cooker. "
38,John Cleese," Have you, er... you read and enjoyed 'The French 
            Lieutenant's Woman', then? "
39,Michael Palin, No. 
40,John Cleese," No... still, it's worth it for the dung, isn't it?
            "
41,Rita Davies," Darling, it's the Milk Marketing Board. For every 
            two cartons of single cream we get the M4 motorway. "
42,Eric Idle," Are you Mr. and Mrs. P. Forbes of 7, the 
            Studios, Elstree? "
43,Michael Palin, Yes. 
44,Eric Idle," Right, well, get in the car. We've won you in a 
            police raffle. "
45,Terry Jones," Yes! This couple is just one of the prizes in 
            this year's Police Raffle. Other prizes include two years for 
            breaking and entering, a crate of search warrants, a 'What's all 
            this then?' T-shirt and a weekend for two with a skinhead of your 
            own choice. "
46,Michael Palin," And that's not all. Three fabulous new prizes 
            have just been added, a four-month supply of interesting . 
            undergarments "
0,Eric Idle," Nigel! Wonderful to see you, super, super, super. 
            Am I a teeny bit late? "
1,Terry Jones," A bit, an hour. "
2,Eric Idle," Oh, super! Only Snowdon's been re-touching my 
            profile and we can't upset the lovely Snowdon, can we? "
3,Terry Jones," Gosh, no. "
4,Eric Idle, 
5,Terry Jones," Well, I... "
6,Eric Idle," It is so nice to have this little talk about 
            things. I heard a teeny rumorlette that you were married. "
7,Terry Jones," Well, not quite, no. My wife's just died, actually.
            "
8,Eric Idle, Oh dear. 
9,Terry Jones," Well, no. I... "
10,Eric Idle," I'll get Peter, William, Arthur, Alex, Joan, Ted, 
            Scott, Will, John and Ray to fix it up. It is so nice having this 
            little chat. "
11,Terry Jones," Well, actually Timmy, I'm glad to get you on your 
            own... "
12,Eric Idle," You don't mind if Peter just sits in, do you? "
13,Terry Jones," Well, actually... "
14,Eric Idle," Only he's doing an article on me for the 'Mail'. 
            He's such a lovely person. "
15,Graham Chapman, Hello. 
16,Eric Idle," Peter, this is one of the nicest people in the 
            world, Nigel Watt. "
17,Terry Jones," Well, actually, Timmy, the thing is, it's a bit 
            private. "
18,Eric Idle," Oh, you don't mind if Peter just sits in, do you? 
            Only Peter's writing a book on me. Peter, you know Tony from the 
            'Mail', don't you? "
19,John Cleese," Yes, we met in the Turkish bath yesterday. "
20,Eric Idle," Super, super. Did it come up well in the writing 
            yesterday? "
21,John Cleese," Great, great, great. "
22,Eric Idle, You took out the tummy references? 
23,John Cleese," Yes, I did. "
24,Eric Idle," Super, super, super. Just to fill you in, this is 
            Nigel Watt and we are having a little heart-to-hem. H-E-A-R-T. 
            Smashing. Do go on, Nigel. "
25,Terry Jones," Well, well, the thing is, Timmy, um er... "
26,Eric Idle," Do carry on, it's the 'TV Times', only they 
            syndicate these photographs to America. Would you mind if we just 
            er... "
27,Terry Jones," Well, the thing is, Timmy, I'm a bit embarrassed.
            "
28,Michael Palin, 
29,Eric Idle," Hello, Mario. Super, wonderful. "
30,Eric Idle," It's German television. Isn't it exciting, Nigel? 
            They're doing a prize-winning documentary on me. "
31,Eric Idle, 
32,Eric Idle, 
33,Terry Jones," Well ... er... as I was saying, Timmy, my wife's 
            gone... gone. "
34,Eric Idle," Sorry, I was on the phone to America. It's been 
            super having this lovely little chat. We must do this again more 
            often. Er... will you get the toffees? I'm afraid I must dash, I'm 
            an hour late for the Israeli Embassy. "
35,Eric Idle," It... it wasn't a bit too wicked, was it? I mean, 
            it wasn't too cruel? "
36,John Cleese," No, no, no. It was great. "
37,Eric Idle," No, super... well, er... I think it shows I'm 
            human, don't you? "
38,John Cleese," Yes, great. "
39,Eric Idle," Super, super. Well, the charabanc's here. Go on, 
            everybody. Bye. "
0,Michael Palin," Good evening. I have with me in the studio 
            tonight one of Britain's leading skin specialists - Raymond Luxury 
            Yacht. "
1,Graham Chapman, That's not my name. 
2,Michael Palin, I'm sorry - Raymond Luxury Yach-t. 
3,Graham Chapman," No, no, no - it's spelt Raymond: Luxury Yach-t, 
            but it's pronounced 'Throatwobbler Mangrove'. "
4,Michael Palin," You're a very silly man and I'm not going to 
            interview you. "
5,Graham Chapman," Ah, anti-Semitism! "
6,Michael Palin, Not at all. It's not even a proper nose. 
7,Graham Chapman, Give me my nose back. 
8,Michael Palin," You can collect it at reception. Now go away.
            "
9,Graham Chapman, I want to be on the television. 
10,Michael Palin, Well you can't.
0,Terry Jones," Er, excuse me, I want to get married. "
1,Eric Idle," I'm afraid I'm already married, sir. "
2,Terry Jones," Er, no, no. I just want to get married. "
3,Eric Idle," I could get a divorce, I suppose, but it'll be 
            a bit of a wrench. "
4,Terry Jones," Er, no, no. That wouldn't be necessary 
            because... "
5,Eric Idle," You see, would you come to my place or should I 
            have to come to yours, because I've just got a big mortgage. "
6,Terry Jones," No, no, I want to get married here. "
7,Eric Idle," Oh dear. I had my heart set on a church 
            wedding. "
8,Terry Jones," Look, I just want you to marry me... to... "
9,Eric Idle," I want to marry you too sir, but it's not as 
            simple as that. You sure you want to get married? "
10,Terry Jones, Yes. I want to get married very quickly. 
11,Eric Idle," Suits me, sir. Suits me. "
12,Terry Jones, I don't want to marry you! 
13,Eric Idle," There is such a thing as breach of promise, 
            sir. "
14,Terry Jones," Look, I just want you to act as registrar and 
            marry me. "
15,Eric Idle," I will marry you sir, but please make up your 
            mind. Please don't trifle with my affections. "
16,Terry Jones," I'm sorry, but... "
17,Eric Idle," That's all right, sir. I forgive you. Lovers' 
            tiff. But you're not the first person to ask me today. I've turned 
            down several people already. "
18,Terry Jones," Look, I'm already engaged. "
19,Eric Idle, 
20,Michael Palin, 
21,Eric Idle," I'm afraid I'm already marrying this gentleman, 
            sir. "
22,Michael Palin," Well, can I get married after him? "
23,Eric Idle," Well, divorce isn't as quick as that, sir. 
            Still, if you're keen. "
24,Graham Chapman, 
25,Eric Idle," Heavens, it's my lucky day, isn't it. All 
            right, but you'll have to wait until I've married these two, sir.
            "
26,Graham Chapman," What, those two getting married... Nigel What 
            are you doing marrying him? "
27,Eric Idle," He's marrying me first, sir. "
28,Graham Chapman, He's engaged to me. 
29,John Cleese, 
30,Eric Idle," Blimey, the wife. "
31,Michael Palin, Will you marry me? 
32,John Cleese, I'm already married. 
33,John Cleese," Well, things turned out all right in the end, 
            but you mustn't ask how 'cos it's naughty. They're all married and 
            living quite well in a council estate near Dulwich."
0,John Cleese," (talking very fast, as do all the 
            commentators): Hello, good evening and welcome to Election Night 
            Special. There's tremendous excitement here at the moment and we 
            should be getting the first results through any moment now. We're 
            not sure where it will be from, it might be Leicester or from West 
            Byfleet, the polling's been quite heavy in both areas. Ah, I'm just 
            getting... I'm just getting... a buzzing noise in my left ear. Urgh, 
            argh! "
1,Michael Palin," And it's a straight fight here at 
            Leicester and we're expecting the result any moment now. There with 
            the Returning Officer is Arthur Smith the sensible candidate and 
            next to him is Jethro Q. Walrustitty the silly candidate with his 
            agent and his silly wife."
2,Eric Idle, 
3,John Cleese, Sensible Party
4,Eric Idle," ...30,612. "
5,John Cleese, Silly Party
6,Eric Idle," ...33,108. (applause)"
7,John Cleese," Well there we have the first result of 
            the election and the Silly party has held Leicester. Norman."
8,Michael Palin," Well pretty much as I predicted, 
            except that the Silly party won. Er, I think this is largely due to 
            the number of votes cast. Gerald."
9,Graham Chapman," Well there's a big swing here to the 
            Silly Party, but how big a swing I'm not going to tell you."
10,Michael Palin," I think one should point out that in 
            this constituency since the last election a lot of very silly people 
            have moved into new housing estates with the result that a lot of 
            sensible voters have moved further down the road the other side of 
            number er, 29."
11,John Cleese," Well I can't add anything to that. 
            Colin?"
12,Eric Idle," Can I just say that this is the first 
            time I've been on television?"
13,John Cleese," No I'm sorry, there isn't time, we're 
            just going straight over to Luton."
14,Graham Chapman," Well here at Luton it's a 
            three-cornered contest between, from left to right, Alan Jones 
            (Sensible Party), Tarquin Fin-tim-lim-bim-lim-bin- bim-bin-bim bus 
            stop F'tang F'tang Olé Biscuit barrel (Silly Party), and Kevin 
            Phillips Bong, who is running on the Slightly Silly ticket. And 
            here's the result."
15,John Cleese, Sensible
16,John Cleese, Slightly Silly
17,John Cleese, Silly
18,John Cleese," Well there you have it, the first 
            result of the election as the Silly Party take Luton. Norman."
19,Michael Palin," Well this is a very significant 
            result. Luton, normally a very sensible constituency with a high 
            proportion of people who aren't a bit silly, has gone completely 
            ga-ga."
20,John Cleese," And we've just heard that James Gilbert 
            has with him the winning Silly candidate at Luton."
21,Eric Idle," Tarquin, are you pleased with this 
            result?"
22,Michael Palin," Ho yes, me old beauty, I should say 
            so. "
23,John Cleese, And do we have the swing at Luton?
24,Graham Chapman, Er... no.
25,John Cleese, 
26,Eric Idle," Can I just say that this is the second 
            time I've been on television?"
27,John Cleese," No, I'm sorry there isn't time, we're 
            just about to get another result."
28,Michael Palin," And this one is from Harpenden 
            Southeast. A very interesting constituency this: in addition to the 
            official Silly candidate there is an unofficial Very Silly 
            candidate, in the slab of concrete, and he could well split the 
            silly vote here at Harpenden Southeast."
29,John Cleese, Silly
30,John Cleese, Sensible
31,John Cleese, Very close!
32,John Cleese, Very Silly
33,John Cleese," Well there you have it, a Sensible gain 
            at Harpenden with the Silly vote being split."
34,Michael Palin," And we've just heard from Luton that 
            Tony Stratton-Smith has with him there the unsuccessful Slightly 
            Silly candidate, Kevin Phillips Bong."
35,Eric Idle," Kevin Phillips Bong. You polled no 
            votes at all. Not a sausage. Bugger all. Are you at all disappointed 
            with this performance?"
36,John Cleese," A very brave Kevin Phillips Bong there. 
            Norman."
37,Michael Palin," And I've just heard from Luton that my 
            aunt is ill. Possibly gastro-enteritis, possibly just catarrh. 
            Gerald."
38,John Cleese," Right. Er, Colin?"
39,Eric Idle," Can I just say that I'll never appear 
            on television again?"
40,John Cleese," No I'm sorry, there isn't time, we have 
            to pick up a few results you may have missed. A little pink 
            pussy-cat has taken Barrow-in-Furness -- that's a gain from the 
            Liberals there. Rastus Odinga Odinga has taken Wolverhampton 
            Southwest, that's Enoch Powell's old constituency -- an important 
            gain there for Darkie Power. Arthur Negus has held Bristols -- 
            that's not a result, that's just a piece of gossip. Sir Alec Douglas 
            Home has taken Oldham for the Stone Dead party. A small piece of 
            putty about that big, a cheese mechanic from Dunbar and two frogs -- 
            one called Kipper the other not -- have all gone ""Ni ni ni ni ni 
            ni!"" in Blackpool Central. And so it's beginning to look like a 
            Silly landslide, and with the prospect of five more years' Silly 
            government facing us we... Oh I don't want to do this any more, I'm 
            bored!"
41,Michael Palin," He's right you know, it is a bloody 
            waste of time."
42,Graham Chapman, Absolute waste of time.
43,Michael Palin, I wanted to be a gynecologist...
0,John Cleese," Oh darling, I'm home. "
1,Carol Cleveland," Hello darling. Had a busy day at the office?
            "
2,John Cleese, Not at all bad. 
3,Graham Chapman," Hi, daddy. "
4,Michael Palin," Hi, daddy. "
5,John Cleese," Hi, Jenny, hi, Robby. "
6,Eric Idle," Heah you are, Mr. Hun! "
7,John Cleese," Hi, Uncle Tom. "
8,Eric Idle," There's a whole horde of them marauding 
            Visigoths to see y'all. "
0,Graham Chapman, Nurse! 
1,Graham Chapman," Hello, Miss Norris. How are you? "
2,Carol Cleveland," Not too bad, thank you, doctor. "
3,Graham Chapman," Yes, well I think I'd better examine you. "
4,Carol Cleveland, What are they doing here? 
5,Graham Chapman," It's all right, they're students. Um... light 
            please, nurse. "
0,Eric Idle," Thank you, thank you. Charles Crompton, the 
            Stripping Doctor. And next, gentlemen and ladies, here at the 
            Peephole Club for the very first time - a very big welcome please 
            for the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs. "
1,Terry Jones," Good evening. Tonight I'd like to restate our 
            position on agricultural subsidies, "
2,Eric Idle," Wasn't he marvellous? The Secretary of State for 
            Commonwealth Affairs! And now gentlemen and ladies, a very big 
            welcome please for the Minister of Pensions and Social Security! "
3,Graham Chapman," Yes, today in Britain there is a new wave of 
            interest in politics and politicians. "
4,Eric Idle," Well, we're just in it for the lobbying, you 
            know. We just love lobbying. "
5,Graham Chapman," And the debates - you know a good debate ... 
            is just... fabulous. "
6,Michael Palin," Well, I've been going with ministers for five 
            years now and, you know... 1 think they're wonderful. "
7,John Cleese," Oh yes, I like civil servants. "
8,Michael Palin," Oh yes, they're nice. "
9,John Cleese, Oh yes. 
10,Graham Chapman, I like Black Rod. 
11,Graham Chapman, What do their parents think? 
12,Terry Jones," Well she's broken our hearts, the little 
            bastard. She's been nothing but trouble and if she comes round here 
            again I'll kick her teeth in. "
0,Michael Palin," Have you been talking to television again, 
            dear? "
1,Terry Jones," Yes, I bloody told 'em. "
2,Michael Palin, What about? 
3,Terry Jones, I dunno. 
4,Michael Palin, Was it Reginald Bosanquet? 
5,Terry Jones," No, no, no. "
6,Michael Palin, Did he have his head all bandaged? 
7,Terry Jones," No, it wasn't like that. They had lots of 
            lights and cameras and tape recorders and all that son of thing. "
8,Michael Palin," Oh, that'll be Ray Baxter and the boys and 
            girls from 'Tomorrow's World'. Oh, I prefer Reginald Bosanquet, 
            there's not so many of them. "
9,Graham Chapman, Hello - Mr. and Mrs. Concrete? 
10,Graham Chapman," Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, 
            well, well, well, well, how very nice. Allow me to introduce myself. 
            I am Leslie Ames, the Chairman of the Test Selection Committee, and 
            I'm very pleased to be able to tell you that your flat has been 
            chosen as the venue for the third test against the West Indies. "
11,Michael Palin, Really? 
12,Graham Chapman," No, it was just a little joke. Actually, I am 
            the Council Ratcatcher. "
13,Michael Palin," Oh yes, we've been expecting you. "
14,Graham Chapman," Oh, I gather you've got a little rodental 
            problem. "
15,Michael Palin," Oh, blimey. You'd think he was awake all 
            the night, scrabbling down by the wainscoting. "
16,Graham Chapman," Um, that's an interesting word, isn't it? "
17,Michael Palin, What? 
18,Graham Chapman," Wainscoting ... Wainscoting ... Wainscoting 
            ... sounds like a little Dorset village, doesn't it? Wainscoting.
            "
19,Graham Chapman," Now, where is it worst? "
20,Michael Palin," Well, down here. You can usually hear them.
            "
21,Graham Chapman, Sshhh 
22,Graham Chapman," No, that's sheep you've got there. "
23,Graham Chapman," No, that's definitely sheep. A bit of a 
            puzzle, really. "
24,Michael Palin, Is it? 
25,Graham Chapman," Yeah, well, I mean it's (a) not going to 
            respond to a nice piece of cheese and (b) it isn't going to fit into 
            a trap. "
26,Michael Palin, Oh - what are you going to do? 
27,Graham Chapman," Well, we'll have to look for the hole. "
28,Michael Palin, Oh yeah. There's one here. 
29,Graham Chapman," No, no, that's mice. "
30,Graham Chapman," Ah, ,this is what we're after. "
31,John Cleese," Excuse me, is the third test in here? "
32,Terry Jones, No - that was a joke - a joke! 
33,John Cleese," Oh blimey, "
34,Graham Chapman," Right. Well, I'm going in the wainscoting. "
35,Graham Chapman, I'm going to lay down some sheep poison. 
36,Graham Chapman, Aagh. Ooh! It's got a gun! 
37,Michael Palin, Blimey. 
38,Graham Chapman," Now, normally a sheep is a placid, timid 
            creature, but you've got a killer."
0,Eric Idle," It's an entirely new strain of sheep, a killer 
            sheep that can not only hold a rifle but is also a first-class shot.
            "
1,Eric Idle," That I don't know. I just don't know. I really 
            just don't know. I'm afraid I really just don't know. I'm afraid 
            even I really just don't know. I have to tell you I'm afraid even I 
            really just don't know. I'm afraid I have to tell you... "
2,Terry Gilliam, ... was wearing... 
3,Eric Idle, ... in yesterday's raid on Selfridges. 
4,John Cleese," Hello, is the third test in here, please? "
5,Eric Idle," This may be even more serious than even I had 
            at first been imagining. What a strange... strange line. There's no 
            time to waste. Get me the Chief Commissioner of Police. "
6,Eric Idle," No, no, on the phone. "
7,Eric Idle, Look of fear! 
8,Eric Idle," Look - there, in the doorway. "
0,Michael Palin," Good evening. Here is the News for parrots. No 
            parrots were involved in an accident on the M1 today, when a lorry 
            carrying high octane fuel was in collision with a hollard ... that 
            is a bollard and not a parrot. A spokesman for parrots said he was 
            glad no parrots were involved. The Minister of Technology "
1,Graham Chapman, 
2,Carol Cleveland," 'Allo, 'allo, 'allo. "
3,Terry Jones," 'Allo, 'allo, 'allo. "
4,Graham Chapman," Who's a pretty boy, then? "
5,Carol Cleveland," 'Allo, 'allo, 'allo. "
6,Michael Palin," And while that's going on, here is the news for 
            gibbons. No gibbons were involved today in an accident on the M 1 
            ... "
0,Eric Idle," In the debate a spokesman accused the Government of 
            being silly and doing not at all gbod things. The member accepted 
            this in a spirit of healthy criticism, but denied that he'd ever 
            been naughty with a choirboy. Angry shouts of 'what about the 
            watermelon, then?' were ordered by the Speaker to be stricken from 
            the record and put into a brown paper bag in the lavvy. Any further 
            interruptions would be cut off and distributed amongst the poor. For 
            the Government a Front Bench Spokesman said the agricultural tariff 
            would have to be raised, and he fancied a bit. Furthermore, he 
            argued, this would give a large boost to farmers, and a lot of fun 
            to him, his friend and Miss Moist of Knightsbridge. From the back 
            benches there were opposition shouts of 'postcards for sale' and a 
            healthy cry of 'who likes a sailor, then?' from the Minister without 
            Portfolio. Replying, the Shadow Minister said, he could no longer 
            deny the rumors but he and the dachshund were very happy; and, in 
            any case, he argued, rhubarb was cheap and what was the harm in a 
            sauna bath. "
1,Michael Palin," ... were not involved. The Minister of 
            Technology "
0,John Cleese," Well that's all for Attila the Bun, and now - 
            idiots! "
1,John Cleese, 
2,Michael Palin," Yes, splendid. "
3,John Cleese," That's Mr. Jenkins - he's another idiot. And so 
            you see the idiot does provide a vital psycho-social service for 
            this community. Oh, excuse me, a coach party has just arrived. I 
            shall have to fall off the wall, I'm afraid. "
4,Graham Chapman," Yes, we have quite a number of idiots 
            banking here. "
5,Graham Chapman," Well nowadays a really blithering idiot can make 
            anything up to ten thousand pounds a year - if he's the head of some 
            big industrial combine. But of course, the more old-fashioned idiot 
            still refuses to take money. "
6,Graham Chapman, 
7,Terry Jones, Mr. Brando. 
8,Graham Chapman, Yes? 
9,Terry Jones, Hollywood on the phone. 
10,Graham Chapman, I'll take it in the office. 
11,Eric Idle," I'm a completely self-taught idiot. I mean, ooh 
            arh, nob arhh, nob arhh .... nobody does that anymore. Anybody who 
            did that round here would be laughed off the street. No, nowadays 
            people want something wittier. "
12,John Cleese, 
13,John Cleese, Well I may be an idiot but I'm no fool. 
14,John Cleese," But the village idiot's dirty smock and 
            wall-falling are a far cry from the modern world of the urban idiot.
            "
15,John Cleese," Eton, Sandhurst and the Guards, ha, ha, 
            ha, ha. "
16,Michael Palin," I can't remember but I've got it 
            written down some where. "
17,Graham Chapman," Daddy's a banker. He needed a wastepaper 
            basket. "
18,Terry Jones," Father was Home Secretary and mother 
            won the Derby. "
19,Graham Chapman," The headquarters of these urban idiots is 
            here in St John's Wood. Inside they can enjoy the company of other 
            idiots and watch special performances of ritual idiotting. "
20,Michael Palin, Well left. 
21,Graham Chapman, Well played. 
22,Eric Idle, Well well. 
23,John Cleese, Well bred. 
24,Terry Jones, 
0,John Cleese," 0OHN) Good afternoon and welcome to Lords on the 
            second day of the first test. So far today we've had five hours 
            batting from England and already they're naught for naught. Cowdrey 
            is not out naught. Naughton is not in. Knott is in and is naught for 
            not out. Naughton of Northants got a nasty knock on the nut in the 
            nets last night but is nothing of note. Next in is Nat Newton of 
            Notts. Not Nutring - Nutting's at nine, er, Nutring knocked neatie 
            nighty knock knock..."
1,Graham Chapman," Splendid. Just listen to those thighs. And now it's 
            the North East's turn with the Samba. Brian. "
2,Eric Idle, 
3,John Cleese," Oh, shut up or we'll close the bar. And now Bo 
            Wildeburg is running up to bowl to Cowdrey, he runs up, he bowls to 
            Cowdrey... "
4,John Cleese," ... and no shot at all. Extremely well not played 
            there. "
5,Graham Chapman," Yes, beautifully not done anything about. "
6,Eric Idle," A superb shot of no kind whatsoever. I well 
            remember Plum Warner leaving a very similar ball alone in 1732. "
7,John Cleese," Oh shut up, long nose. "
8,Graham Chapman, Gin and tonic please. 
9,John Cleese," No, no the players are having drinks. And now, what's 
            happening? I think Cowdrey's being taken off. "
10,Eric Idle," I well remember a similar divan being brought on at 
            Headingley in 9 BC against the darkies. "
11,John Cleese," Oh, shut up, elephant snout. And now the green 
            Chesterfield has taken guard and Iceland are putting on their spin 
            dryer to bowl. "
12,John Cleese," The spin dryer moves back to his mark, it runs out to 
            the wicket, bowls to the table... a little bit short but it's coming 
            in a bit there and it's hit him on the pad... and the table is out, 
            leg before wicket. That is England naught for one. "
13,Eric Idle," Well here at Epsom we take up the running 
            with fifty yards of this mile and a half race to go and it's the 
            wash basin in the lead from WC Pedestal. Tucked in nicely there is 
            the sofa going very well with Joanna Southcott's box making a good 
            run from hat stand on the rails, and the standard lamp is failing 
            fast but it's wash basin definitely taking up the running now being 
            strongly pressed by ... At the post it's the wash basin from WC then 
            sofa, hat stand, standard lamp and lastly Joanna Southcott's box."
0,John Cleese," And could we have the next contender, 
            please? "
1,Terry Jones," Yes, yes; "
2,John Cleese, And what's your name? 
3,Terry Jones, I go to church regularly. 
4,John Cleese," Jolly good, I see, and which prize do you 
            have particular eyes on this evening? "
5,Terry Jones, I'd like the blow on the head. 
6,John Cleese, The blow on the head. 
7,Terry Jones, Just there. 
8,John Cleese," Jolly good. Well your first question for 
            the blow on the head this evening is: what great opponent of 
            Cartesian dualism resists the reduction of psychological phenomena 
            to physical states? "
9,Terry Jones, I don't know that! 
10,John Cleese," Well, have a guess. "
11,Terry Jones, Henri Bergson. 
12,John Cleese, Is the correct answer! 
13,Terry Jones," Ooh, that was lucky. I never even heard of him. "
14,John Cleese, Jolly good. 
15,Terry Jones, I don't like darkies. 
16,John Cleese," Ha ha ha. Who does! And now your second 
            question for the blow on the head is: what is the main food that 
            penguins eat? "
17,Terry Jones, Pork luncheon meat. 
18,John Cleese, No. 
19,Terry Jones, Spam? 
20,John Cleese," No, no, no. What do penguins eat? Penguins.
            "
21,Terry Jones, Penguins? 
22,John Cleese, Yes. 
23,Terry Jones, I hate penguins. 
24,John Cleese," No, no, no. "
25,Terry Jones, They eat themselves. 
26,John Cleese," No, no, what do penguins eat? "
27,Terry Jones, Horses! ... Armchairs! 
28,John Cleese," No, no, no. What do penguins eat? "
29,Terry Jones," Oh, penguins. "
30,John Cleese, Penguins. 
31,Terry Jones, Cannelloni. 
32,John Cleese, No. 
33,Terry Jones," Lasagna, moussaka, lobster thermidor, escalopes de 
            veau a l'estragon avec endives gratineed with cheese. "
34,John Cleese," No, no, no, no. I'll give you a clue. "
35,Terry Jones, Ah! Brian Close. 
36,John Cleese, No. no. 
37,Terry Jones," Brian Inglis, Brian Johnson, Bryan Forbes. "
38,John Cleese," No, no! "
39,Terry Jones, Nanette Newman.

            in nets? "
41,Terry Jones, Henri Bergson. 
42,John Cleese, No. 
43,Terry Jones," Goats. Underwater goats with snorkels and flippers.
            "
44,John Cleese," No, no. "
45,Terry Jones, A buffalo with an aqualung. 
46,John Cleese," No, no. "
47,Terry Jones, Reginald Maudling. 
48,John Cleese," Yes, that's near enough. I'll give you 
            that. Right, now, Mrs. Scum, you have won your prize, do you still 
            want the blow on the head? "
49,Terry Jones," Yes, yes. "
50,John Cleese, I'll offer you a poke in the eye. 
51,Terry Jones, No! I want a blow on the head. 
52,John Cleese, A punch in the throat. 
53,Terry Jones, No. 
54,John Cleese," All fight then, a kick in the kneecap. "
55,Terry Jones, No. 
56,John Cleese," Mrs. Scum, I'm offering you a boot in the 
            teeth and a dagger up the strap. "
57,Terry Jones, Er... 
58,Terry Jones," No, no. I'll take the blow on the head. "
59,John Cleese," Very well then, Mrs. Scum, you have won 
            tonight's star prize, the blow on the head. "
0,Eric Idle," Here is a preview of some of the programs 
            you'll be able to see coming shortly on BBC Television. To kick off 
            with there's variety ... "
0,Michael Palin," Hello. On 'Archaeology Today' tonight I have 
            with me Professor Lucien Kastner of Oslo University. "
1,Terry Jones, Good evening. 
2,Michael Palin," How tall are you, professor? "
3,Terry Jones, ... I beg your pardon? 
4,Michael Palin, How tall are you? 
5,Terry Jones, I'm about five foot ten. 
6,Michael Palin," ... and an expert in Egyptian 'tomb 
            paintings. Sir Robert... "
7,Terry Jones, Yes. 
8,Michael Palin," Funny, you look much shorter than that to me. 
            Are you slumped forward in your chair at all? "
9,Terry Jones," No, er I... "
10,Michael Palin," Extraordinary. Sir Robert Eversley, who's 
            just returned from the excavations in El Ara, and you must be well 
            over six foot. Isn't that right, Sir Robert? "
11,John Cleese, 
12,Michael Palin," In fact, I think you're six foot five aren't 
            you? "
13,John Cleese, Yes. 
14,Michael Palin," Oh, that's marvellous. I mean you're a 
            totally different kind of specimen to Professor Kastner. Straight in 
            your seat, erect, firm. "
15,John Cleese," Yes. I thought we were here to discuss 
            archaeology. "
16,Michael Palin," Yes, yes, of course we are, yes, absolutely, 
            you're absolutely right! That's positive thinking for you. "
17,John Cleese, 
18,Michael Palin, Very good speaking voice. 
19,John Cleese," ... which present dramatic evidence of 
            Polynesian influence in Egypt in the third dynasty which is quite 
            remarkable. "
20,Michael Palin, How tall were the Polynesians? 
21,Terry Jones, They were... 
22,Michael Palin, Sh! 
23,John Cleese," Well, they were rather small, seafaring... "
24,Michael Palin," Short men, were they... eh? All squat and 
            bent up? "
25,John Cleese," Well, I really don't know about that... "
26,Michael Palin, Who were the tall people? 
27,John Cleese, I'm afraid I don't know. 
28,Michael Palin, Who's that very tall tribe in Africa? 
29,John Cleese," Well, this is hardly archaeology. "
30,Michael Palin," The Watutsi! That's it - the Watutsi! Oh, 
            that's the tribe, some of them were eight foot tall. Can you imagine 
            that. Eight foot of Watutsi. Not one on another's shoulders, oh no - 
            eight foot of solid Watutsi. That's what I call tall. "
31,John Cleese," Yes, but it's nothing to do with archaeology.
            "
32,Michael Palin, 
33,Terry Jones," Can I please speak! I came all the way from Oslo 
            to do this program! I'm a professor of archaeology. I'm an expert in 
            ancient civilizations. All right, I'm only five foot ten. All right 
            my posture is bad, all right I slump in my chair. But I've had more 
            women than either of you two! I've had half bloody Norway, that's 
            what I've had! So you can keep your Robert Eversley! And you can 
            keep your bloody Watutsi! I'd rather have my little body... my 
            little five-foot-ten-inch body... "
34,John Cleese, Bloody fool. Look what you've done to him. 
35,Michael Palin, Don't bloody fool me. 
36,John Cleese," I'll do what I like, because I'm six foot five 
            and I eat punks like you for breakfast. "
37,Michael Palin," I'll get you for that, Eversley! I'll get you 
            if I have to travel to the four corners of the earth! "
38,Carol Cleveland, 
39,John Cleese," Today I hear the robin sing Today the thrush 
            is on the wing Today who knows what life will bring Today... "
40,John Cleese," Why, a Sumerian drinking vessel of the fourth 
            dynasty. "
41,John Cleese," Yes, it's... Sumerian. "
42,Carol Cleveland," Oh, how wonderful! Oh, I am so happy for you.
            "
43,John Cleese," I'm happy too, now at last we know there was a 
            Sumerian influence here in Abu Simnel in the early pre-dynastic 
            period, two thousand years before the reign of Tutankhamun, "
44,Michael Palin," All right Eversley, get up out of that 
            trench. "
45,John Cleese, Don't forget... I'm six foot five. 
46,Michael Palin, That doesn't worry me... Kastner. 
47,Terry Jones, Here Lord. 
48,Michael Palin, Up! 
49,John Cleese, Eleven foot three! 
50,Terry Jones, I'm so tall! I am so tall! 
51,John Cleese, Danielle! 
52,Michael Palin, Eleven foot six - damn you! Abdul 
53,John Cleese, Fifteen foot four! Mustapha! 
54,Michael Palin, Nineteen foot three... damn you! 
55,Michael Palin," And there we end this edition of 'Archaeology 
            Today'. Next week, the Silbury Dig by Cole Porter with Pearl Bailey 
            and Arthur Negus. "
0,Michael Palin," And now an appeal for sanity from the 
            Reverend Arthur Belling."
1,Graham Chapman," You know, there are many people in the 
            country today who, through no fault of their own, are sane. Some of 
            them were born sane. Some of them became sane later in their lives. 
            It is up to people like you and me who are out of our tiny little 
            minds to try and help these people overcome their sanity. You can 
            start in small ways with ping-pong ball eyes and a funny voice and 
            then you can paint half of your body red and the other half green 
            and then you can jump up and down in a bowl of treacle going 
            'squawk, squawk, squawk...' And then you can go 'Neurhhh! Neurhh!' 
            and then you can roll around on the floor going 'pting pting pting' 
            ... "
2,Michael Palin," The Reverend Arthur Belling is Vicar of St 
            Loony Up The Cream Bun and Jam. And now an appeal on behalf of the 
            National Trust."

0,Terry Jones, Good morning. 
1,Terry Jones, I have that function. 
2,Terry Jones, What do you mean? 
3,Terry Jones," Ah, oh, no. That was when you were married. "
4,Terry Jones, I can't do that. 
5,Terry Jones," No, you can't do that. "
6,Terry Jones," I'm sorry sir, but we're not allowed to change.
            "
7,Terry Jones, You can't. 
8,Terry Jones, It's different. 
9,Terry Jones," Well, you can't change a bloody wife! "
10,Terry Jones, No! 
11,John Cleese," All right, break it up. What's your number, then? 
            All right. Name? "
0,Michael Palin, Next please. Name? 
1,Graham Chapman," Er, Watson. "
2,Michael Palin, (writing it down) Mr. Watson. 
3,Graham Chapman," Ah, no, Doctor. "
4,Michael Palin," Ah, Mr. Doctor. "
5,Graham Chapman," No, not Mr, Doctor. "
6,Michael Palin," Oh, Doctor Doctor. "
7,Graham Chapman," No, Doctor Watson. "
8,Michael Palin," Oh, Doctor Watson Doctor. "
9,Graham Chapman," Oh, just call me darling. "
10,Michael Palin," Hello, Mr. Darling. "
11,Graham Chapman," No, Doctor. "
12,Michael Palin, Hello Doctor Darling. 
0,Graham Chapman," Ah, John. Allow me to introduce my next-door 
            neighbour. John Stokes, this is A Sniveling Little Rat-Faced Git. 
            Ah! "
1,Terry Jones," Hello, I noticed a slight look of anxiety cross 
            your face for a moment just then, but you needn't worry - I'm used 
            to it. That's the trouble of having a surname like Git. "
2,Michael Palin," Oh ... yes, yes. "
3,Terry Jones," We did think once of having it changed by 
            deed-poll, you know - to Watson or something like that. But A 
            Sniveling Little Rat-Faced Watson's just as bad eh? "
4,Michael Palin," Yes, yes, I suppose so. "
5,Terry Jones," Oh, that's my wife. Darling! Come and meet Mr... 
            what was it? "
6,Michael Palin, Stokes-John Stokes. 
7,Terry Jones," Oh yes. John Stokes, this is my wife, Dreary Fat 
            Boring Old. "
8,Michael Palin," Oh, er, how do you do. "
9,John Cleese, How do you do. 
10,Carol Cleveland," Darling, there you are! "
11,Michael Palin," Yes, yes, here I am, yes. "
12,Terry Jones," Oh, is this your wife? "
13,Michael Palin," Yes, yes, yes, this is the wife. Yes. Um darling, 
            these, these are the Gits. "
14,Carol Cleveland, 
15,Michael Palin, The Gits. 
16,Terry Jones," Oh, heaven's sakes we are being formal. Does it 
            have to be surnames? "
17,Michael Palin," Oh, no, no. Not at all. No. Um, no, this... this... 
            this is my wife Norah, er, Norah Jane, Norah Jane Stokes. This is 
            Sniveling Little Rat-Faced Git. And this is his wife Dreary Fat 
            Boring Old Git. "
18,Terry Jones," I was just telling your husband what an awful 
            bore it is having a surname like Git. "
19,Carol Cleveland, 
20,Terry Jones," Oh, you've no idea how the kids get taunted. Why, 
            only last week Dirty Lying Little Two-Faced came running home from 
            school, sobbing his eyes out, and our youngest, Ghastly Spotty 
            Horrible Vicious Little is just at the age when taunts like 'she's a 
            git' really hun. Yes. "
21,Michael Palin, Do ... do you live round here? 
22,Terry Jones," Yes, we live up the road, number 49 - you can't 
            miss it. We've just had the outside painted with warm pus. "
23,Michael Palin, 
24,Terry Jones," Yes. It's very nice actually. It goes nicely with 
            the vomit and catarrh we've got smeared all over the from door. "
25,Carol Cleveland," I think we ought to be going. We have two 
            children to collect. "
26,Terry Jones," Oh, well, bring them round for tea tomorrow. "
27,Carol Cleveland, Well... 
28,Terry Jones," It's Ghastly Spotty Cross-Eyed's birthday and 
            she's having a disemboweling party for a few friends. The Nauseas 
            will be there, and Doug and Janice Mucus, and the Rectums from 
            Swanage. "
29,Michael Palin, 
30,Graham Chapman," John! Allow me to introduce our next-door neighbor. 
            John, this is Mr. Watson. "
31,Graham Chapman," Hello. I noticed a slight look of anxiety cross 
            your face just then but you needn't worry. "
32,Carol Cleveland, I preferred the dirty version. 
0,Graham Chapman," Well, I've been a hunter all my life. I love 
            animals. That's why I like to kill 'em. I wouldn't kill an animal I 
            didn't like. Good day Roy. "
1,John Cleese," (JOHN) Hank and Roy Spire are tough, fearless 
            backwoodsmen who have chosen to live in a violent, unrelenting world 
            of nature's creatures, where only the fittest survive. Today they 
            are off to hunt mosquitoes. "
2,Eric Idle, 
3,John Cleese," Suddenly Hank spots the mosquito they're 
            after. "
4,John Cleese," Now more than ever, they must rely on the 
            skills they have learnt from a lifetime's hunting. "
5,Eric Idle," There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded 
            mosquito. "
6,John Cleese," But the hunt is not over. With well practiced 
            skill Hank skins the mosquito. "
7,Graham Chapman," Well, I follow the moth in the helicopter to lure it 
            away from the flowers, and then Roy comes along in the Lockheed 
            Starfighter and attacks it with air-to-air missiles. "
8,Eric Idle," A lot of people have asked us why we don't use fly 
            spray. Well, where's the sport in that? "
9,John Cleese," For Roy, sport is everything. Ever since he 
            lost his left arm battling with an ant, Roy has risked his life in 
            the pursuit of tiny creatures. "
0,Eric Idle, 
1,Michael Palin, 
2,Eric Idle," Objection here, objection there! And that 
            nice policeman giving his evidence so well - beautiful speaking 
            voice ... well after a bit all I could do was bang my little gavel.
            "
3,Michael Palin," You what, love? "
4,Eric Idle," I banged me gavel. I did me 'silence in 
            court' bit. Ooh! If looks could kill that prosecuting counsel would 
            be in for thirty years. How did your summing up go? "
5,Michael Palin," Well, I was quite pleased actually. I was 
            trying to do my butch voice, you know, 'what the jury must 
            understand', and they loved it, you know. I could see that foreman 
            eyeing me. "
6,Eric Idle, Really? 
7,Michael Palin," Yes, cheeky devil. "
8,Eric Idle," Was he that tall man with that very big... ?
            "
9,Michael Palin," No, just a minute - I must finish you know. 
            Anyway, I finished up with 'the actions of these vicious men is a 
            violent stain on the community and the full penalty of the law is 
            scarcely sufficient to deal with their ghastly crimes', and I 
            waggled my wig! Just ever so slightly, but it was a stunning effect.
            "
10,Eric Idle," Oh, I bet it was... like that super time I 
            wore that striped robe in the Magistrates Court. "
11,Michael Palin," Oh, aye. "
0,Eric Idle," Hello, Mrs. Thing. "
1,Graham Chapman," Hello, Mrs. Entity. "
2,Eric Idle, How are you then? 
3,Graham Chapman," Oh, I have had a morning. "
4,Eric Idle, Busy? 
5,Graham Chapman," Busy - huh! I got up at five o'clock, I 
            made myself a cup of tea, I looked out of the window. Well, by then 
            I was so worn out I had to come and have a sit-down. I've been here 
            for seven hours. "
6,Eric Idle, You must be exhausted. 
7,Graham Chapman," Mm. Oh, have you been shopping? "
8,Eric Idle," No, I've been shopping. "
9,Graham Chapman, Funny. 
10,Eric Idle," I'm worn out. I've been shopping for six 
            hours. "
11,Graham Chapman," What have you bought, then? "
12,Eric Idle," Nothing. Nothing at all. A complete waste 
            of time. "
13,Graham Chapman," Wicked, isn't it? "
14,Eric Idle," Wicked. It'll be worse when we join the 
            Common Market. "
15,Graham Chapman," That nice Mr. Heath would never allow 
            that. "
16,Eric Idle, It's funny he never married. 
17,Graham Chapman, He's a bachelor. 
18,Eric Idle," Oooh! That would explain it, Oh dear me, 
            this chatting away wears me out. "
19,Graham Chapman," Yes. I bet Mrs. Reginald Maudling 
            doesn't have to put up with all this drudgery, getting up at five in 
            the morning, making a cup of tea, looking out of the window, 
            chatting away. "
20,Eric Idle, No! It'd all be done for her. 
21,Graham Chapman," Yes, she'd have the whole day free for 
            playing snooker. "
22,Eric Idle," She probably wouldn't go through all the 
            drudgery of playing snooker, day in, day out. "
23,Graham Chapman," No, it would all be done for her. She 
            wouldn't even have to lift the cue."
24,Eric Idle," She 
            probably doesn't even know where the billiard room is. "
25,Graham Chapman," No, still, it's not as bad as the old 
            days. Mrs. Stanley Baldwin used to have to get up at five o'clock in 
            the morning and go out and catch partridges with her bare hands. "
26,Eric Idle," Yes... and Mrs. William Pitt the EIder 
            used to have to get up at three o'clock and go burrowing for 
            truffles with the bridge of her nose. "
27,Graham Chapman," Mrs. Beethoven used to have to get up at 
            midnight to spur on the mynah bird. "
28,Eric Idle," Lazy creatures, mynah birds,.. "
29,Graham Chapman," Yes. When Beethoven went deaf the mynah 
            bird just used to mime. "
30,Eric Idle, 
31,Graham Chapman, It's all right. It's only a flashback.
0,John Cleese," You don't fool me, you stupid mynah bird. I'm 
            not deaf yet. "
1,John Cleese, Shut up! 
2,John Cleese," Shut your beak. Gott in Himreel... I never get 
            any peace here. "
3,Graham Chapman, Ludwig! 
4,John Cleese, What? 
5,Graham Chapman, Have you seen the sugar bowl? 
6,John Cleese," No, I haven't seen the bloody sugar bowl. "
7,Graham Chapman, You know ... the sugar bowl. 
8,John Cleese," Sod the sugar bowl... I'm trying to finish this 
            stinking tune! It's driving me spare ... so shut up! "
9,Graham Chapman," Ludwig, have you seen the jam spoon? "
10,John Cleese, Stuff the jam spoon! 
11,Graham Chapman, It was in the sugar bowl. 
12,John Cleese," Look, get out you old rat-bag. Buzz off and 
            shut up. "
13,Graham Chapman," I don't know what you see in that piano.
            "
14,John Cleese, Leave me alone!! ... 
15,Graham Chapman," Do you want peanut butter or sandwich 
            spread for your tea? "
16,John Cleese, What!!!! 
17,Graham Chapman, PEANUT BUTTER... 
18,John Cleese, I've forgotten it. 
19,Graham Chapman," Do you want peanut butter or sandwich 
            spread? "
20,John Cleese, I don't care!! 
21,John Cleese, I had it. I had it you old bag. 
22,Graham Chapman, 
23,John Cleese," Gott in Himreel, I'm going out. "
24,Graham Chapman," Well, if you're going out don't forget 
            we've got the Mendelssohn's coming for tea so don't forget to order 
            some pikelets. "
25,John Cleese," Pikelets, pikelets. Shakespeare never had this 
            trouble. "
0,Eric Idle," You wanna bet? Incidentally, its da-da-da-dum, 
            da-da-da-dum. "
1,John Cleese," You're right. Oh, incidentally, why not call 
            him Hamlet? "
2,Eric Idle, Hamlet I like much better than David. 
3,Terry Jones," Thanks, but I've had a better idea. "
4,Terry Jones," Yes, dear! "
5,Terry Jones," Oh, my life. "
6,Michael Palin, 
7,Michael Palin," Aha! Rats at 42a Kartoffelnstrasse. Hey 
            Mitzi! I gotta go to Potato Street. "
8,Michael Palin, 
9,Graham Chapman, Yes? 
10,Michael Palin, Colin Mozart. 
11,Graham Chapman," Oh, thank goodness you've come. We're 
                having a terrible time with them bleeding rats. I think they 
                live in his stupid piano already. "
12,John Cleese," Get out the bloody piano you stupid 
                furry bucktoothed gits! Get out! Gott in Himmel. Get your 
                stinking tail out of my face. "
13,John Cleese, Shut up! 
0,Eric Idle," Well, I was ever so glad they abolished 
            hanging, you know, because that black cap just didn't suit me. "
1,Michael Palin," Yes. Do you remember the Glasgow treason 
            trial? "
2,Eric Idle," Oh yes, I wore a body stocking all through 
            it. "
3,Michael Palin," No, hen, with the party afterwards. "
4,Eric Idle," Oh, that's right. You were walking out with 
            that very butch Clerk of the Court. "
5,Michael Palin," That's right. Ooh, he made me want to turn 
            Queen's evidence. "
6,Eric Idle," Oh, me too. One summing up and I'm anybody's.
            "
7,Michael Palin," Anyway, Bailie Anderson. "
8,Eric Idle," Ooh, her? "
9,Michael Palin," Yes. She's so strict. She was on at me for 
            giving dolly sentences, you know, specially in that arson case. "
10,Eric Idle, What was the verdict? 
11,Michael Palin, They preferred the brown wig. 
12,Eric Idle," Mm. I love the Scottish Assizes. I know what 
            they mean by a really well-hung jury. "
13,Michael Palin," Oohl Get back in the witness box, you're too 
            sharp to live! "
14,Eric Idle, I'll smack your little botty! 
15,Michael Palin, Ooh! and again. 
16,Eric Idle," Have you tried that new body rub JP's use?
            "
17,Michael Palin," 1 had a magistrate in Bradford yesterday.
            "
18,Eric Idle," Funnily enough I felt like one in a lunchtime 
            recess today. "
19,Michael Palin," Oh, aye, of course, they're as bent as 
            safety pins. "
20,Eric Idle," I know, but they've got beautiful speaking 
            voices, haven't they? 'And now a choice of viewing on BBC 
            Television.' "
21,Michael Palin, 'Here are tonight's football results.' 
22,Michael Palin, Mmm. 
0,John Cleese," How to recognize different parts of the body.
            "
1,John Cleese, Number one. The foot. 
2,John Cleese, Number two. The shoulder. 
3,John Cleese, And number three. The other foot. 
4,John Cleese, Number four. The bridge of the nose. 
5,John Cleese, Number five. The naughty bits. 
6,John Cleese, Number six. Just above the elbow. 
7,John Cleese," Number seven. Two inches to the right of a 
            very naughty bit indeed. "
8,John Cleese, Number eight. The kneecap. 
0,Graham Chapman," G'day, Bruce!"
1,Eric Idle," Oh, Hello Bruce!"
2,Michael Palin, How are you Bruce?
3,Eric Idle," A bit crook, Bruce."
4,Graham Chapman, Where's Bruce?
5,Eric Idle," He's not 'ere, Bruce."
6,Michael Palin," Blimey, it's hot in here, Bruce."
7,Eric Idle, Hot enough to boil a monkey's bum!
8,Graham Chapman," That's a strange expression, Bruce."
9,Eric Idle," Well Bruce, I heard the Prime Minister use 
            it. ""It's hot enough to boil a monkey's bum in here, your Majesty,"" 
            he said and she smiled quietly to herself."
10,Michael Palin," She's a good Sheila Bruce, and not at all 
            stuck up."
11,Graham Chapman," Here! Here's the boss-fellow now! - how are 
            you bruce?"
12,John Cleese," 'Ow are you, Bruce?"
13,Eric Idle, G'day Bruce!
14,John Cleese, Bruce.
15,Graham Chapman, Hello Bruce.
16,John Cleese, Bruce.
17,Michael Palin," How are you, Bruce?"
18,John Cleese, G'day Bruce.
19,John Cleese," Gentleman, I'd like to introduce man from 
            Pommeyland who is joinin' us this year in the philosophy department 
            at the University of Walamaloo."
20,Terry Jones, Hello.
21,John Cleese," Michael Baldwin, Bruce. Michael Baldwin, 
            Bruce. Michael Baldwin, Bruce."
22,Eric Idle, Is your name not Bruce?
23,Terry Jones," No, it's Michael."
24,Graham Chapman, That's going to cause a little confusion.
25,Michael Palin," Mind if we call you ""Bruce"" to keep it clear?"
26,John Cleese," Gentlemen, I think we better start the 
            faculty meeting. Before we start, though, I'd like to ask the padre 
            for a prayer."
27,Eric Idle," Oh Lord, we beseech Thee, Amen!!"
28,John Cleese, Crack tubes! 
29,Graham Chapman," I'd like to welcome the pommey bastard to 
            God's own Earth, and remind him that we don't like stuck-up 
            sticky-beaks here."
30,John Cleese," Bruce here teaches classical philosophy, 
            Bruce there teaches Haegelian philosophy, and Bruce here teaches 
            logical positivism. And is also in charge of the sheep dip."
31,Michael Palin, What's New-Bruce going to teach?
32,John Cleese," New-Bruce will be teaching political 
            science, Machiavelli, Bentham, Locke, Hobbes, Sutcliffe, Bradman, 
            Lindwall, Miller, Hassett, and Benaud."
33,Graham Chapman, Those are all cricketers!
34,John Cleese," Aww, spit!"
35,Michael Palin," Hails of derisive laughter, Bruce!"
36,John Cleese, Bruce: Crack tube! 
37,Graham Chapman," New-Bruce, are you a Poofter?"
38,John Cleese, Are you a Poofter?
39,Terry Jones, No!
40,John Cleese," No. Right, I just want to remind you of the 
            faculty rules: Rule One! "
41,John Cleese," Rule Two, no member of the faculty is to 
            maltreat the Abbos in any way at all -- if there's anybody watching. 
            Rule Three? "
42,John Cleese," Rule Four, now this term, I don't want to 
            catch anybody not drinking. Rule Five, "
43,John Cleese," Rule Six, there is NO ... Rule Six. Rule 
            Seven, "
44,John Cleese," Right, that concludes the readin' of the 
            rules, Bruce."
45,Eric Idle," This here's the wattle, the emblem of our 
            land. You can stick it in a bottle, you can hold it in your hand."
46,Eric Idle," Right, let's get some Sheilas. "
47,John Cleese, OK. 
48,Graham Chapman," Ah, elevenses. "
49,Michael Palin, This should tide us over 'til lunchtime. 
50,Graham Chapman," Reckon so, Bruce. "
51,Eric Idle, Sydney Nolan! What's that! 
0,John Cleese, Number ten. The big toe. 
1,John Cleese, Number eleven. More naughty bits. 
2,John Cleese," Number twelve. The naughty bits of a lady, "
3,John Cleese," Number thirteen. The naughty bits of a horse,
            "
4,John Cleese," Number fourteen. The naughty bits of an ant.
            "
5,John Cleese," Number fifteen. The naughty bits of Reginald 
            Maudling. "
6,John Cleese, Number sixteen. The hand. 
0,Michael Palin (in the TV Series)," With me now is Norman St. John Polevaulter, who for 
            the last few years has been contradicting people. St. John 
            Polevaulter, why do you contradict people?"
1,Terry Jones (in the TV Series), I don't!
2,Michael Palin (in the TV Series), But you... you told me that you did.
3,Terry Jones (in the TV Series), I most certainly did not!
4,Michael Palin (in the TV Series), Oh. I see. I'll start again.
5,Terry Jones (in the TV Series), No you won't!
6,Michael Palin (in the TV Series), Ssh! I understand you don't contradict people.
7,Terry Jones (in the TV Series), Yes I do!
8,Michael Palin (in the TV Series), And when didn't you start contradicting them?
9,Terry Jones (in the TV Series), I did! In 1952!
10,Michael Palin (in the TV Series), 1952.
11,Terry Jones (in the TV Series), 1947!
12,Michael Palin (in the TV Series), 23 years ago.
13,Terry Jones (in the TV Series), No!
0,John Cleese, Number nineteen. The nose. 
1,John Cleese, Come in. 
2,John Cleese," Ah! Mr. Luxury Yacht. Do sit down, please. "
3,John Cleese," Well, do sit down then Mr. Throatwobbler 
            Mangrove. "
4,John Cleese," Now, what seems to be the trouble? "
5,John Cleese," I see. And which particular feature of your 
            anatomy is causing you distress? "
6,John Cleese," Yes. To be absolutely blunt you're worried 
            about your enormous hooter. "
7,John Cleese, No? 
8,John Cleese," Yes, and you want me to hack a bit off. "
9,John Cleese," Fine. It is a startler, isn't it. Er, do you 
            mind if I... er. "
10,John Cleese," Oh, no nothing, then, well, I'll just examine 
            your nose. "
11,John Cleese," Well, you've had the operation, you strange 
            person. "
12,John Cleese," Well, all right, all right, but only ... if 
            you come on a camping holiday with me. "
0,Michael Palin," Next week we'll be showing you how to pick up 
            an architect, how to pull a prime minister, and how to have fun with 
            a wholesale poulterer. But now the men of the Derbyshire Light 
            Infantry entertain us with a precision display of bad temper. "
1,John Cleese, Attention 
2,Michael Palin," And next the men of the Second Armored 
            Division regale us with their famous close order swanning about. "
3,Michael Palin, And finally... 
0,Eric Idle," Morning sir, can I help you? "
1,Graham Chapman," Er, yes, we've booked on your flight for 
            America. "
2,Eric Idle," Oh, we don't fly to America ... "
3,Carol Cleveland, Is it really 37/6d? 
4,Eric Idle, Thirty bob. I'm robbing myself. 
5,Graham Chapman, Thirty bob! 
6,Eric Idle," Twenty-five. Two quid the pair of yer. Er, that's 
            without insurance. "
7,Graham Chapman," Well, how much is it with insurance? "
8,Eric Idle," Hundred and two quid. That's including the flight.
            "
9,Graham Chapman, Do we really need insurance? 
10,Eric Idle, No. 
11,Graham Chapman," Well, we'll have it with insurance please.
            "
12,Eric Idle," Right - do you want it with the body and one relative 
            flown back, or you can have both bodies flown back and no relatives, 
            or four relatives, no bodies, and the ashes sent by parcel post. "
13,Graham Chapman, How long will it take? 
14,Eric Idle," Er, let me put it this way - no idea. "
15,Michael Palin, Six hours. 
16,Graham Chapman, Six? 
17,Eric Idle," Five, ten for the pair of you. "
18,Carol Cleveland," Oh, is it a jet? "
19,Eric Idle," Well, no ... It's not so much of a jet, it's more 
            your, er, Triumph Herald engine with wings. "
20,Graham Chapman, When are you taking off?. 
21,Eric Idle, 3300 hours. 
22,Graham Chapman, What? 
23,Eric Idle, 2600 hours for the pair of you. 
24,Carol Cleveland, What? 
25,Eric Idle," Have the injections, you won't care. "
26,Graham Chapman, What injections? 
27,Eric Idle," Barley sugar injections. Calm you down. They're 
            compulsory - Board of Trade. Promise. "
28,Carol Cleveland," Oh, I don't like the sound of injections.
            "
29,Eric Idle, 
30,Carol Cleveland, Yes. 
31,Eric Idle," Right, you can't change your mind. I'll ring the 
            departure lounge. "
32,Terry Jones," Now, the duty-free trolley is over there ... 
            there's some lovely drop scones and there's duty-free broccoli and 
            there's fresh eccles cakes. You're allowed two hundred each on the 
            plane. "
33,Eric Idle, Nearly ready. 
34,Terry Jones, 
35,Terry Jones," That's Mr. Kamikaze, the pilot, he's very 
            nice really, but make sure he stays clear of battleships. "
36,John Cleese," There have been many stirring tales told of 
            the sea and also some fairly uninteresting ones only marginally 
            connected with it, like this one. Sorry, this isn't a very good 
            announcement. Sorry."
0,John Cleese," That was last year's re-enactment of the Battle 
            of Pearl Harbor performed by the BatIey Townswomen's Guild. It was 
            written, directed and produced by Mrs. Rita Fairbanks. "
1,Eric Idle, Hello again. 
2,Michael Palin," And what are your ladies going to do for us 
            this year. "
3,Eric Idle," Well, this year we decided to re-enact something 
            with a more modern flavor. We had considered a version of Michael 
            Stewart's speech on Nigeria and there were several votes on the 
            Committee for a staging of Herr Willi Brandt's visit to East 
            Germany, but we've settled instead for a dramatization of the first 
            heart transplant. Incidentally my sister Madge will be playing the 
            plucky little springbok pioneer Christian Barnard. "
4,Michael Palin," Well off we go, then with the Barley 
            Townswomen's Guild re-enactment of the first heart transplant. "
0,John Cleese, 
1,John Cleese," The underwater version of 'Measure for 
            Measure', and further out to sea 'Hello Dolly' is also doing good 
            business. "
2,John Cleese," · · · and over there on the oyster beds Formula 
            2 car racing. "
0,John Cleese," And now the BBC is proud to present a 
            brand new radio drama series, ""The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots."" 
            Part One: The Beginning."
1,John Cleese," Stay tuned for part two of the Radio Four 
            Production of ""The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots"", coming 
            up...almost immediately."
2,John Cleese," that was episode two of ""The Death of Mary, 
            Queen of Scots"", specially adapted for radio by Gracie Fields and 
            Joe Frazier. And now, Radio Four will explode."
3,Graham Chapman, We'll have to watch the Telly-vision!
4,John Cleese, Aaaaw. 
5,Graham Chapman," What's that on top of the telly-vision 
            set?"
6,John Cleese, (matter-of-factly) Looks like a penguin.
7,John Cleese," It's been a long time there, now, has 
            it?"
8,Graham Chapman, What's it doin' there?
9,John Cleese, Standin'!
10,Graham Chapman, I can see that!
11,Graham Chapman," If it laid an egg, it would roll down the 
            back of the telly-vision set."
12,John Cleese, Ummmm. I hadn't thought of that.
13,Graham Chapman, Unless it's a male.
14,John Cleese, Yes. It looks fairly butch.
15,Graham Chapman, Per'aps it's from next door.
16,John Cleese, 
17,Graham Chapman, (yet louder) BURMA!!!
18,John Cleese, Why'd'j say that?
19,Graham Chapman, I panicked.
20,John Cleese, Oh.
21,Graham Chapman, Per'aps it's from the zoo.
22,John Cleese, Which zoo?
23,Graham Chapman, 
24,John Cleese, 'Oo's Doctor bloody Bernofsky?
25,Graham Chapman, He knows everything.
26,John Cleese," Oooh, I wouldn't like that, that'd take 
            all the mystery out of life."
27,John Cleese," Besides, if it were from the zoo, it'd 
            have ""property of the zoo"" stamped on it."
28,Graham Chapman," They don't stamp animals ""property of the 
            zoo""!! You can't stamp a huge lion ""property of the zoo""!!"
29,John Cleese, 
30,Graham Chapman, 
31,John Cleese, Lions don't molt.
32,Graham Chapman," No, but penguins do. THERE! I've run 
            rings around you logically."
33,John Cleese, 
34,Graham Chapman," 'Ow did 'e know that was going to 
            happen?!"
0,John Cleese, That's not a part of the body. 
1,Carol Cleveland," NO, it's a link though. "
2,Graham Chapman, I didn't think it was very good. 
3,John Cleese," No, it's the end of the series, they must be 
            running out of ideas. "
4,Michael Palin," All fight, don't anybody move, there's been a 
            murder. "
5,Carol Cleveland, A murder? 
6,Michael Palin," No... no ... not a murder... no what's like a 
            murder only begins with B? "
7,Graham Chapman, Birmingham. 
8,Michael Palin, No ... no ... no ... no ... no... 
9,John Cleese, BurnIey? 
10,Michael Palin," Burnley - that's right! Burnley in Lancashire. 
            There's been a Burnley. "
11,Graham Chapman, Burglary. 
12,Michael Palin," Burglary. Yes, good man. Burglary - that's it, of 
            course. There's been a burglary."
13,John Cleese, Where? 
14,Michael Palin," In the back, just below the rib. "
15,John Cleese, No - that's murder. 
16,Michael Palin," Oh... er no... in the band... In the bat... 
            Barclays bat. "
17,Graham Chapman, Barclays Bank? 
18,Michael Palin," Yes. Nasty business - got away with £23,000. "
19,Graham Chapman, Any clues? 
20,Michael Palin, Any what? 
21,Graham Chapman, Any evidence as to who did it? 
22,Michael Palin, 
23,John Cleese, I thought you said it was a burglary. 
24,Michael Palin," Burglary is almost as serious a business as 
            murder. Some burglaries are more serious than murder. A burglary in 
            which someone gets stabbed is murder! So don't come these petty 
            distinctions with me. You're as bad as a judge. Right, now! The 
            first thing to do in the event of a breach of the peace of any kind, 
            is to... go... "
25,John Cleese, Ring the police? 
26,Michael Palin," Ring the police. Yes, that's a good idea. Get them 
            over here fast ... no, on second thoughts, get them over here 
            slowly, so they don't drop anything. "
27,Carol Cleveland, Shall I make us all a cup of tea? 
28,Michael Palin," Make what you like, Boskovitch - it won't help you 
            in court. "
29,Carol Cleveland, I beg your pardon? 
30,Michael Palin," I'm sorry, sorry. That's the trouble with being on 
            two cases at once. I keep thinking I've got Boskovitch cornered and 
            in fact I'm investigating a Burnley. "
31,Graham Chapman, Burglary. 
32,Michael Palin, Burglary! Yes - good man. 
33,John Cleese, Who's Boskovitch? 
34,Michael Palin," Hah! Boskovitch is a Russian scientist who is 
            passing information to the Russians. "
35,Graham Chapman, Classified information? 
36,Michael Palin," Oh, there he goes again! 'Classified information'! 
            Oh, sitting on the 'settee' with our 'scones' and our 'classified 
            information'! "
0,Michael Palin," Ah! Hello, Duckie. "
1,Terry Jones," Hello, sir. How are you? "
2,Michael Palin, I'm fine thanks. How are you? 
3,Terry Jones," Well, sir, I'm a little bit moody today, sir."
4,Michael Palin," Why's that, Duckie?"
5,Terry Jones, Because...
6,Terry Jones," Wheeeeen I smile,"
7,Terry Jones," Wheeeeen I'm sad,"
8,Terry Jones, I'm (He's) a little bit sad and lonely.
9,Michael Palin," A lovely song, Duckie."
10,Eric Idle," And that's the final entry. La derniere entree. Das 
            final entry. And now, guten abend. Das scores. The scores. Les 
            scores. Dei scores. Oh! Scores. Ha! Scores! "
11,Michael Palin, 
12,Graham Chapman, 
13,Graham Chapman, Bing tiddle tiddle BANG
14,Michael Palin, Number thirty-one. The end.

13,Terry Jones, Qu'est-ce que vous avez dit? 
14,Carol Cleveland, J'ai dit 'oh'. 
15,Terry Jones, Ah. Tres interessant. 
16,Eric Idle," Brian Distel and Brianette Zatapathique there in an 
            improvised scene from Jean Kenneth Longueur's new movie 'Le Fromage 
            Grand'. Brian and Brianette symbolize the breakdown in communication 
            in our modern society in this exciting new film and Longueur is 
            saying to us, his audience, 'go on, protest, do something about it, 
            assault the manager, demand your money back'. Later on in the film, 
            in a brilliantly conceived montage, Longueur mercilessly exposes the 
            violence underlying our society when Brian and Brianerte again meet 
            on yet another rubbish dump. "
17,Terry Jones, Bonjour encore. 
18,Carol Cleveland, Bonjour.

27,Carol Cleveland, Oui. 
28,Terry Jones, Il fait beau bier. Ha ha ha. 
29,Carol Cleveland, Ha ha. 
30,Terry Jones, Quel surprise de vous voir encore. 
31,Carol Cleveland, Je t'aime. 
32,Terry Jones, Je t'aime. 
0,Eric Idle," Pretty strong meat there from Longueur who is 
            saying, of course, that ultimately materialism, in this case the 
            Webb's Wonder lettuce, must destroy us all. That was for O. Simon, 
            K. Simon, P. Simon and R. Sparrow of Leicester. Later on, we're 
            going to take a look at John Wayne's latest movie, 'Buckets of Blood 
            Pouring Out of People's Heads' but now we look ahead. On Tuesday 
            Chris Conger took a BBC film unit to the location where 20th Century 
            Vole are shooting their latest epic 'Scott of the Antarctic'."
1,Graham Chapman," Sea, sand and sunshine make Paignton the queen of 
            the English Riviera. But for the next six months this sleepy 
            Devonshire resort will be transformed into the blizzard-swept wastes 
            of the South Pole. For today shooting starts on the epic 'Scott of 
            the Antarctic', produced by Gerry Schlick. "
2,Eric Idle, 
3,Graham Chapman," Gerry, you chose Paignton as the location for 
            Scott. "
4,Eric Idle," Right, right. "
5,Graham Chapman," Isn't it a bit of a drawback that there's no snow 
            here? "
6,Eric Idle," Well, we have 28,000 cubic feet of Wintrex, which 
            is a new white foam rubber which actually on screen looks more like 
            snow than snow... "
7,Eric Idle," ... and 1,600 cubic US furlongs of white paint, 
            with a special snow finish. "
8,Graham Chapman," And I believe Kirk Vilb is playing the tide role.
            "
9,Eric Idle," That is correct. We were very thrilled and 
            honored when Kirk agreed to play the part of Lieutenant Scott "
10,John Cleese," Oh, there you are. Hello. Hello. No problem. Have 
            a drink. Have a drink. Great. Hello. Marvellous. Marvellous. Hello. 
            Rewrite. Oh this is really great. I mean, it's really saying 
            something, don't you think? "
11,Graham Chapman, Have you started shooting yet? 
12,John Cleese," Yes, yes. Great. Perfect. No, no, we haven't 
            started yet. No. But great - great. "
13,Graham Chapman," What is the first scene that you shoot this 
            morning? "
14,John Cleese," Great. Terrific. Oh it's great. No problem. We'll 
            sort it out on the floor. Sort it out on the floor. No problem. This 
            film is basically pro-humanity and anti-bad things and it rips aside 
            the hypocritical facade of our society's gin and tonic and leaves a 
            lot of sacred cows rolling around in agony, have a drink, have a 
            drink. "
15,Graham Chapman," But which scene are we shooting first, Jimmy? "
16,John Cleese," Yes, great. Oh, marvellous. "
17,Eric Idle," No, we didn't. "
18,John Cleese," We didn't. Oh great. That's even better. I'll 
            put it back in. Rewrite. "
19,Eric Idle," Now in this scene Lieutenant Scott returns to 
            camp in the early morning after Walking the huskies to have brunch 
            with the rest of his team. "
20,Terry Jones," Hi, Lieutenant. "
21,Michael Palin," Hi, Oatesy. Sure is a beautiful day already. "
22,John Cleese, 
23,Michael Palin, What? What are you saying? 
24,John Cleese," I was just saying great, great. Cue Evans. "
25,Eric Idle, And this is Vanilla Hoare as Miss Evans. 
26,Graham Chapman, Miss Evans? 
27,Eric Idle, Right. 
28,Michael Palin," Good morning, Miss Evans. "
29,Carol Cleveland," Oh, I've forgotten my line. "
30,Carol Cleveland," Oh, yeah. 'Good morning, Captain.' Sc'..; oh, I'm 
            just not happy with that line. Could I just say Hi Scottie ? "
31,John Cleese, Great. Great. Rewrite. Cue. 
32,John Cleese, Great! We'll shoot it. 
33,Michael Palin, Are you sure that's right? 
34,John Cleese," Oh, it's great. "
35,Eric Idle, Jim. 
36,John Cleese," Jim! Jim! Oh, me! "
37,Eric Idle," Jim, I feel we may be running into some problems 
            here in the area of height. "
38,John Cleese, Great! Where are they? 
39,Eric Idle, Where are who? 
40,John Cleese, I don't know. I was getting confused. 
41,Eric Idle," Jim, I feel here, that Scott may be too tall in 
            the area of height with reference to Vanilla who is too near the 
            ground in the area of being too short at this time. "
42,John Cleese," Great ... Oh, I know. I'm going to dig a pit for 
            Scott and put a box in Vanilla's trench. "
43,Michael Palin," Say, why don't I take the boxes off and Vanilla get 
            up out of the trench. "
44,John Cleese," It wouldn't work... It's even better! Great. 
            Rewrite! "
45,Carol Cleveland, What was that? 
46,John Cleese," Oh, it's easy. I've worked it out. Scott takes 
            his boxes off and you don't stand in the trench. "
47,Carol Cleveland, I say my lines out of the trench? 
48,John Cleese, Even better. Great. 
49,Carol Cleveland," But I've never acted out of a trench. I might fall 
            over. It's dangerous. "
50,John Cleese," Oh well, could you just try it? "
51,Carol Cleveland," Look, you crumb bum, I'm a star. Star, star, star. 
            I don't get a million dollars to act out of a trench. I played Miss 
            St John the Baptist in a trench, "
52,John Cleese," Great. Great everyone. Lunch now. Lunch. It's 
            all in the can. Good morning's work. "
53,Eric Idle, But you haven't done a shot. 
54,John Cleese, Just keeping morale up. 
55,Eric Idle," Now this afternoon we're going to shoot the scene 
            where Scott gets off the boat on to the ice floe and he sees the 
            lion and he fights it and kills it and the blood goes pssssssssshhh 
            in slow motion. "
56,Graham Chapman, But there aren't any lions in the Antarctic. 
57,Eric Idle, What? 
58,Graham Chapman, There aren't any lions in the Antarctic. 
59,Eric Idle," You're right. There are no lions in the 
            Antarctic. That's ridiculous; whoever heard of a lion in the 
            Antarctic. Right. Lose the lion. "
60,John Cleese, Got to keep the lion. It's great! 
61,Eric Idle, Lose the lion. 
62,John Cleese," Great. We're losing the lion. Rewrite. Lose the 
            lion everyone. That's fantastic, "
63,Michael Palin, What's this about our losing the lion? 
64,Eric Idle," Well, Kirk, we thought perhaps we might lose the 
            fight with the lion a little bit, Kirk, angel. "
65,Michael Palin, 
66,Eric Idle," Well, Kirkie, doll, there are no lions in the 
            Antarctic, baby. "
67,Michael Palin, 
68,Eric Idle, It'd be silly. 
69,Michael Palin," Listen, I gotta fight the lion. That's what that 
            guy Scott's all about. I know. I've studied him already. "
70,Eric Idle, But why couldn't you fight a penguin? 
71,John Cleese, Great! 
72,Michael Palin, Fight a rotten penguin? 
73,Eric Idle," It needn't be a little penguin. It can be the 
            biggest penguin you've ever seen. An electric penguin, twenty feet 
            high, with long green tentacles that sting people, and you can stab 
            it in the wings and the blood can go spurting psssssshhhh in slow 
            motion. "
74,Michael Palin, The lion is in the contract. 
75,Eric Idle, He fights the lion. 
76,John Cleese," Even better. Great. Have a drink. Lose the 
            penguin. Stand by to shoot. "
77,Eric Idle, Where do they have lions? 
78,Graham Chapman, Africa. 
79,Eric Idle," That's it. Scott's in Africa. As many lions as we 
            need. "
80,John Cleese, Great! 
81,Eric Idle," He's looking for a pole no one else knows about. 
            That ties in with the sand. Right. Paint the sand yellow again. 
            Okay, let's get this show on the road. 'Scott of the Sahara.'"
0,Michael Palin," Booming out of the pages of history comes a 
            story of three men and one woman whose courage shocked a generation.
            "
1,Michael Palin, From the same team that brought you ... 
2,Michael Palin," See Ensign Oates' frank adult death struggle 
            with the spine-chilling giant electric penguin... "
3,Michael Palin," ... See Miss Evans pursued by the man-eating 
            roll-top writing desk. "
4,John Cleese, And now for something completely different.
0,John Cleese, 
1,Michael Palin, A what?
2,John Cleese," A license for my pet fish, Eric."
3,Michael Palin, How did you know my name was Eric?
4,John Cleese," No, no, no! My fish's name is Eric. Eric fish. 
            He's an halibut."
5,Michael Palin, What?
6,John Cleese, He is an halibut.
7,Michael Palin, You've got a pet halibut?
8,John Cleese," Yes, I chose him out of thousands. I didn't like 
            the others, they were all too flat."
9,Michael Palin, You must be a loony.
10,John Cleese," I am not a loony. Why should I be tarred with the 
            epithet 'loony' merely because I have a pet halibut? I've heard tell 
            that Sir Gerald Nabarro has a pet prawn called Simon - you wouldn't 
            call him a loony! Furthermore Dawn Pathorpe, the lady showjumper, 
            had a clam called Stafford, after the late chancellor. Alan Bullock 
            has two pikes, both called Chris, and Marcel Proust had an 'addock! 
            So if you're calling the author of 'A la recherche de temps perdu' a 
            loony, I shall have to ask you to step outside!"
11,Michael Palin," All right, all right, all right. A license?"
12,John Cleese, Yes!
13,Michael Palin, For a fish.
14,John Cleese, Yes!
15,Michael Palin, You *are* a loony.
16,John Cleese," Look, it's a bleeding pet, isn't it? I've got a 
            license for me pet dog Eric, I've got a license for me pet cat Eric."
17,Michael Palin, You don't need a license for your cat.
18,John Cleese," I bleedin' well do and I've got one! Can't be 
            caught out there!"
19,Michael Palin, There is no such thing as a bloody Cat license.
20,John Cleese, Yes there is.
21,Michael Palin, No there isn't.
22,John Cleese, Is!
23,Michael Palin, Isn't!
24,John Cleese, Is!
25,Michael Palin, Isn't!
26,John Cleese, Is!
27,Michael Palin, Isn't!
28,John Cleese, Is!
29,Michael Palin, Isn't!
30,John Cleese, Is!
31,Michael Palin, Isn't!
32,John Cleese, Is!
33,Michael Palin, Isn't!
34,John Cleese, What's that then?
35,Michael Palin," This is a dog license with the word 'dog' crossed 
            out and 'cat' written in in crayon."
36,John Cleese, Man didn't have the right form.
37,Michael Palin, What man?
38,John Cleese, The man from the cat detector van.
39,Michael Palin," The loony detector van, you mean."
40,John Cleese," Look, it's people like you what cause unrest."
41,Michael Palin, What cat detector van?
42,John Cleese," The cat detector van from the Ministry of 
            Housinge."
43,Michael Palin, Housinge?
44,John Cleese," It was spelt like that on the van. I'm very 
            observant. I never seen so many bleedin' aerials. The man said their 
            equipment could pinpoint a purr at four hundred yards, and Eric 
            being such a happy cat was a piece of cake."
45,Michael Palin, How much did you pay for this?
46,John Cleese, Sixty quid and eight for the fruit-bat.
47,Michael Palin, What fruit-bat?
48,John Cleese, Eric the fruit-bat.
49,Michael Palin, Are all your pets called Eric?
50,John Cleese," There's nothing so odd about that. Kemel Attaturk 
            had an entire menagerie called Abdul."
51,Michael Palin, No he didn't.
52,John Cleese, Did!
53,Michael Palin, Didn't!
54,John Cleese," Did, did, did, did, did and did!"
55,Michael Palin, Oh all right.
56,John Cleese," Spoken like a gentleman, sir. Now, are you going 
            to give me a fish license?"
57,Michael Palin," I promise you that there is no such thing. You 
            don't need one."
58,John Cleese," Then I would like a statement to that effect 
            signed by the Lord Mayor. "
59,Michael Palin, You're in luck. 
60,John Cleese, In that case give me a bee license.
61,Michael Palin, A license for your pet bee.
62,John Cleese, Correct.
63,Michael Palin, Called Eric? Eric the bee?
64,John Cleese, No.
65,Michael Palin, No?
66,John Cleese," No, Eric the half bee. He had an accident."
67,Michael Palin, You're off your chump.
68,John Cleese," Look, if you intend by that utilization of an 
            obscure colloquialism to imply that my sanity is not up to scratch, 
            or even to deny the semi-existence of my little chum Eric the half 
            bee, I shall have to ask you to listen to this. Take it away, Eric 
            the orchestra-leader."
69,Eric Idle, A one... two-- A one... two... three... four...
70,John Cleese," Half a bee, philosophically,"
71,John Cleese," Is this wretched demi-bee,"
72,John Cleese," I love this hive, employee-ee,"
73,John Cleese, The end.
74,Michael Palin, Cyril Connelly?
75,John Cleese, No; semi-carnally!
76,Michael Palin, Oh.
0,John Cleese," And now, there is the Mayor. Surely the third 
            tallest mayor in Derby's history. And there are the Aldermen 
            magnificently resplendent in their Aldermanic hose and just look at 
            the power in those thighs. The New Zealanders are going to find it 
            pretty tough going in the set pieces in the second half... So Dawn 
            Palethorpe with one clear round on Sir Gerald... and now the Mayor 
            has reached the Great Customer Mr. Eric Praline. "
1,Michael Palin," (MICHAEL) Cliff, this must have been a very 
            disappointing result for the All Blacks. "
2,Graham Chapman, 
3,Michael Palin, And what about China? 
4,Graham Chapman," Well, whether Mao Tse Tung is alive or not, Lin 
            Piao has a stranglehold on central committee which Lin Shao Chi 
            can't break, so it remains to be seen whether Chou En Lai can really 
            get his finger out and get going in the second half. "
5,Michael Palin," Well, thank you Cliff. Tonight's other 
            outstanding match was the semi-final between the Bournemouth 
            Gynecologists and the Watford Long John Silver Impersonators. We 
            bring you edited highlights of the match. "
6,Michael Palin," Well, that's about it for tonight ladies and 
            gentlemen, but remember if you've enjoyed watching the show just 
            half as much as we've enjoyed doing it, then we've enjoyed it twice 
            as much as you. Ha, ha, ha. "
0,John Cleese, Come in. 
1,Eric Idle," S. Frog, sir. "
2,John Cleese," Shut up, I want to have a word with you, Frog. "
3,Eric Idle," S. Frog, sir. "
4,John Cleese," Shut up. It's about your advertising campaign for 
            Conquistador Coffee. Now, I've had the managing director of 
            Conquistador to see me this morning and he's very unhappy with your 
            campaign. Very unhappy. In fact, he's shot himself. "
5,Eric Idle," Badly, sir? "
6,John Cleese," No, extremely well. "
7,Eric Idle," S. Frog, sir. "
8,John Cleese, Shut up. Why did you do it? 
9,Eric Idle, It was a joke. 
10,John Cleese, A joke? 
11,Eric Idle," No, no not a joke, a sales campaign. "
12,John Cleese," I see, Frog. "
13,Eric Idle," S. Frog, sir. "
14,John Cleese," Shut up. Now, let's have a look at the sales chart.
            "
15,Eric Idle," It was a soft-sell, sir "
16,John Cleese," Why, Frog? "
17,Eric Idle," S. Frog, sir. "
18,John Cleese, Shut up! Well? 
19,Eric Idle," Well, people know the name, sir. "
20,John Cleese," They certainly do know the name - they burnt the 
            factory down. The owner is hiding in the bathroom "
21,Eric Idle," You're not going to fire me, sir? "
22,John Cleese," Fire you? Three men dead, the factory burnt down, 
            the account lost and our firm completely bankrupt, what... what... 
            what ... can you possibly say? What excuse can you possibly make?
            "
23,Eric Idle," Sorry, father. "
24,John Cleese," Oh, yes. Oh, incidentally your film's won a prize.
            "
0,John Cleese," Sorry about that. And now for something 
            completely diff... "
0,John Cleese," Hello, come in. "
1,Terry Jones," Well, I... "
2,John Cleese," All right then, the briefcase and the umbrella. A 
            river down, must be my final offer. "
3,Terry Jones," Well, I don't want to sell them. I've come for a job.
            "
4,John Cleese," Oh, take a seat, take a seat. "
5,Terry Jones, Thank you. 
6,John Cleese," I see you chose the canvas chair with the aluminum 
            frame. I'll throw that in and a river, for the briefcase and the 
            umbrella ... no, make it fair, the briefcase and the umbrella and 
            the two pens in your breast pocket and the chair's yours and a river 
            and a pair of ex-German U-boat commando's binoculars. "
7,Terry Jones," Really, they are not for sale. "
8,John Cleese," Not for sale, what does that mean? "
9,Terry Jones," I came about the advertisement for the job of 
            assistant editor. "
10,John Cleese," Oh yeah, right. Ah, OK, ah. How much experience in 
            journalism? "
11,Terry Jones, Five years. 
12,John Cleese," Right, typing speed? "
13,Terry Jones, Fifty. 
14,John Cleese, 0 Levels? 
15,Terry Jones, Eight. 
16,John Cleese, A Levels? 
17,Terry Jones, Two. 
18,John Cleese," Right... Well, I'll give you the job, and the 
            chair, and an all-wool ex-army sleeping bag ... for the briefcase, 
            umbrella, the pens in your breast pocket and your string vest. "
19,Terry Jones, When do I start? 
20,John Cleese, Monday. 
21,Terry Jones, That's marvellous. 
22,John Cleese, If you throw in the shoes as well. 
23,John Cleese," Two ex-army greatcoats and the alarm clock and a 
            table lamp, for two coffees and biscuits. "
24,John Cleese," Two greatcoats, one table lamp and a desert boat.
            "
25,John Cleese, Done. 
0,Carol Cleveland," Anyway, John, you can catch the 11.30 from 
            Hornchurch and be in Basingstoke by one o'clock, oh, and there's a 
            buffet car and... "
1,Eric Idle, My hat! Sir Horace! 
2,Carol Cleveland, 
3,Eric Idle," Yes - after breakfast. But that doesn't matter 
            now... he's dead. "
4,Carol Cleveland, Oh! Poor daddy... 
5,Eric Idle, Looks like I shan't be catching the 11.30 now. 
6,Carol Cleveland," Oh no, John, you mustn't miss your train. "
7,Eric Idle," How could I think of catching a train when I should 
            be here helping you? "
8,Carol Cleveland," Oh, John, thank you... anyway you could always 
            catch the 9.30 tomorrow - it goes via Caterham and Chipstead. "
9,Eric Idle, Or the 9.45's even better. 
10,Carol Cleveland," Oh, but you'd have to change at Lambs Green. "
11,Eric Idle," Yes, but there's only a seven-minute wait now. "
12,Carol Cleveland," Oh, yes, of course, I'd forgotten it was Friday. 
            Oh, who could have done this. "
13,Graham Chapman," Oh, do hurry Sir Horace, your train leaves 
            in twenty-eight minutes, and if you miss the 10.15 you won't catch 
            the 3.45 which means ... oh! "
14,Eric Idle," I'm afraid Sir Horace won't be catching the 10.15, 
            Lady Partridge. "
15,Graham Chapman, Has he been... ? 
16,Carol Cleveland, Yes - after breakfast. 
17,Eric Idle," Lady Partridge, I'm afraid you can cancel his seat 
            reservation. "
18,Graham Chapman," Oh, and it was back to the engine - fourth 
            coach along so that he could see the gradient signs outside 
            Swanborough. "
19,Eric Idle," Not any more Lady Partridge... the line's been 
            closed. "
20,Graham Chapman, Closed! Not Swanborough! 
21,Eric Idle, I'm afraid so. 
22,Terry Jones," All fight, nobody move. I'm Inspector Davis of 
            Scotland Yard. "
23,Eric Idle," My word, you were here quickly, inspector. "
24,Terry Jones," Yeah, I got the 8.55 Pullman Express from 
            King's Cross and missed that bit around Hornchurch. "
25,Graham Chapman, It's a very good train. 
26,Michael Palin, Hello everyone. 
27,Michael Palin, Where's daddy? 
28,Carol Cleveland," Yes, after breakfast. "
29,Michael Palin," Then ... he won't be needing his reservation on the 
            10.15. "
30,Eric Idle, Exactly. 
31,Michael Palin," And I suppose as his eldest son it must go to me.
            "
32,Terry Jones," Just a minute, Tony There's a small matter 
            of... murder. "
33,Michael Palin," Oh, but surely he simply shot himself and then hid 
            the gun. "
34,Graham Chapman," How could anyone shoot himself and then 
            hide the gun without first cancelling his reservation. "
35,Michael Palin," Ha, ha! Well, I must dash or I'll be late for the 
            10.15. "
36,Terry Jones," I suggest yOu murdered your father for his seat 
            reservation. "
37,Michael Palin," I may have had the motive, inspector, but I could 
            not have done it, for I have only just arrived from Gillingham on 
            the 8.13 and here's my restaurant car ticket to prove it. "
38,Carol Cleveland," The 8. 13 from Gillingham doesn't have a 
            restaurant car. "
39,Eric Idle, It's a standing buffet only. 
40,Michael Palin," Oh, er... did I say the 8.13, I meant the 7.58 
            stopping train. "
41,Graham Chapman," But the 7.58 stopping train arrived at 
            Swindon at 8.19 owing to annual point maintenance at Wisborough 
            Junction. "
42,Eric Idle," So how did you make the connection with the 8. I3 
            which left six minutes earlier? "
43,Michael Palin," Oh, er, simple! I caught the 7.16 Football Special 
            arriving at Swindon at 8.09. "
44,Carol Cleveland," But the 7.16 Football Special only stops at 
            Swindon on alternate Saturdays. "
45,Graham Chapman," Yes, surely you mean the Holidaymaker 
            Special. "
46,Michael Palin," Oh, yes! How daft of me. Of course I came on the 
            Holidaymaker Special calling at Bedford, Colmworth, Fen Dinon, 
            Sutton, Wallington and Gillingham. "
47,Terry Jones, That's Sundays only! 
48,Michael Palin," Damn. All fight, I confess I did it. I killed him 
            for his reservation, but you won't take me alive! I'm going to throw 
            myself under the 10.12 from Reading. "
49,Eric Idle," Don't be a fool, Tony, don't do it, the 10.12 has 
            the new narrow traction bogies, you wouldn't stand a chance. "
50,Michael Palin, Exactly. 
0,John Cleese," That was an excerpt from the latest West End 
            hit 'It all happened on the 11.20 from Hainault to Redhill via 
            Horsham and Reigate, calling at Carshalton Beeches, Malmesbury, 
            Tooting Bec, and Croydon West'. The author is Mr. Neville Shunt."
1,Terry Gilliam," (typing) Chuff, chuff, chuffwoooooch, woooooch! 
            Sssssssss, sssssssss! Diddledum, diddledum, diddlealum. Toot, toot. 
            The train now standing at platform eight, tch, tch, tch, diddledum, 
            diddledum. Chuffff chuffffiTff eeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa Vooooommmmm. "
2,John Cleese," Some people have made the mistake of seeing 
            Shunt's work as a load of rubbish about railway timetables, but 
            clever people like me, who talk loudly in restaurants, see this as a 
            deliberate ambiguity, a plea for understanding in a mechanized 
            world. The points are frozen, the beast is dead. What is the 
            difference? What indeed is the point? The point is frozen, the beast 
            is late out of Paddington. The point is taken. If La Fontaine's elk 
            would spurn Tom Jones the engine must be our head, the dining car 
            our oesophagus, the guard's van our left lung, the cattle truck our 
            shins, the first-class compartment the piece of skin at the nape of 
            the neck and the level crossing an electric elk called Simon. The 
            clarity is devastating. But where is the ambiguity? It's over there 
            in a box. Shunt is saying the 8.15 from Gillingham when in reality 
            he means the 8.13 from Gillingham. The train is the same only the 
            time is altered. Ecce homo, ergo elk. La Fontaine knew his sister 
            and knew her bloody well. The point is taken, the beast is molting, 
            the fluff gets up your nose. The illusion is complete; it is 
            reality, the reality is illusion and the ambiguity is the only 
            truth. But is the truth, as Hitchcock observes, in the box? No there 
            isn't room, the ambiguity has put on weight. The point is taken, the 
            elk is dead, the beast stops at Swindon, Chabrol stops at nothing, 
            I'm having treatment and La Fontaine can get knotted. "
3,Michael Palin, Gavin Millar... 
4,Terry Jones, ... rrrrrrr... 
5,Michael Palin," ... was not talking to Neville Shunt. From the world 
            of the theatre we turn to the world of dental hygiene. No, no, no, 
            no. From the world of the theatre we move to the silver screen. We 
            honor one of the silver screen's outstanding writer-dentists... 
            writer-directors, Martin Curry who is visiting London to have a 
            tooth out, for the pre-molar, er... premiere of his filling, film 
            next Toothday... Tuesday, at the Dental Theatre... Film Theatre. 
            Martin Curry talking to Matthew Palate... Padget."
0,Terry Jones," Martin Curry, welcome. One of the big teeth... big 
            points that the American critics made about your latest film, 'The 
            Twelve Caesars', was that it was on so all-embracing a topic. What 
            made you undertake so enormous a tusk... task? "
1,Graham Chapman," Well I've always been interested in Imperial Rome 
            from Julius Caesar right through to Vethpathian. "
2,Terry Jones, Who? 
3,Graham Chapman, Vethpathian. 
4,Terry Jones, Ah! Vespasian. 
5,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
6,Terry Jones," When I saw your film it did seem to me that you 
            had taken a rather, urn, subjective approach to it. "
7,Graham Chapman, I'm sorry? 
8,Terry Jones," Well, I mean all your main characters had these 
            enormous ... well not enormous, these very big ... well let's have a 
            look at a clip in which Julius Incisor .... Caesar talks to his 
            generals during the baffle against Caractacus. "
9,Graham Chapman, I don't see that at all. 
10,Terry Jones, 
11,Graham Chapman, 
12,Terry Jones," Martin Curry, why do all your characters have 
            these very big er ... very big um ... teeth? "
13,Graham Chapman, What do you mean? 
14,Terry Jones," Well, I mean, er... and even in your biblical 
            epic, 'The Son of Man', John the Baptist had the most enormous ... 
            dental appendages ... and of course ... himself had the most 
            monumental ivories. "
15,Graham Chapman," No, I'm afraid I don't see that at all. "
16,Terry Jones," Oh, a straw, yes, yes. Well while we're doing that 
            perhaps we could take another look at an earlier film, 'Trafalgar'.
            "
17,Eric Idle," Cover my coat, Mr. Bush, the men must not know of 
            this till victory is ours. "
18,Terry Jones," The surgeon's coming, sir. "
19,Eric Idle," No, tell the surgeon to attend the men that can be 
            saved. He can do little for me, I fear. "
20,Terry Jones," Aye, aye, sir. "
21,Eric Idle, Hardy! Hardy! 
22,Michael Palin, Sir? 
23,Eric Idle," Hardy...' kiss... er ... put your hand on my 
            thigh. "
24,Terry Jones," Martin Curry, thank you. Well. We asked the 
            first-night audience what they thought of that film. "
0,John Cleese, It wasn't true to life. 
1,Terry Jones, Yes it was. 
2,Eric Idle, No it wasn't. 
3,Graham Chapman, I thought it was totally bizarre. 
4,Michael Palin," Well I've been in the city for over forty 
            years and I think the importance of looking after poor people cannot 
            be understressed. "
5,Graham Chapman," Well I've been in the city for twenty 
            years and I must admit - I'm lost. "
6,John Cleese," Well, I've been in the city all my life 
            and I'm as alert and active as I've ever been. "
7,Eric Idle," Well I've been in the city since I was 
            two and I certainly' wouldn't say that I was stuck in a rut... stuck 
            in a rut ... stuck in a rut... stuck in a rut... "
8,Terry Jones," Oh dear, Mr. Bulstrode's stuck again. "
9,Eric Idle," I certainly wouldn't say that I was stuck 
            in a rut. "
10,John Cleese," Well I've been in the city for thirty 
            years and I've never once regretted being a nasty, greedy, cold 
            hearted, avaricious, money-grubber ... Conservative. "
11,Terry Jones," Well I've been in the city for 
            twenty-seven years and I would like to see the reintroduction of 
            flogging. Every Thursday, round at my place. "
12,John Cleese, 
13,John Cleese, I think it must be a naturalist outing. 
14,Terry Jones, I think it must be one of them crackpot religions.
0,Eric Idle," This is an example of the sort of abuse we get 
            all the time from ignorant people. I inherited this religion from my 
            father, an ex-used-car salesman and part-time window-box, and I am 
            very proud to be in charge of the first religion with free gifts. 
            You get this luxury tea-trolley with every new enrolment. (pictures 
            of this and the subsequent gifts) In addition to this you can win a 
            three-piece lounge suite, this luxury caravan, a weekend for two 
            with Peter Bonetti and tonight's star prize, the entire Norwich City 
            Council. "
1,Eric Idle," And remember with only eight scoring draws you 
            can win a bishopric in a see of your own choice. You see we have a 
            much more' modern approach to religion. "
2,Eric Idle," Blessed is Arthur Crackpot and all his 
            subsidiaries Ltd. You see, in our Church we have a lot more fun. "
3,John Cleese, 
4,Michael Palin," I don't mind, I don't mind - it's just nice 
            to be here, Reverend. "
5,John Cleese, 
6,Michael Palin, I've got one already. 
7,Eric Idle," A lot of religions - no names no pack drill - do 
            go for the poorer type of person - face it, there's more of 'era - 
            poor people, thieves, villains, poor people without no money at all 
            - well we don't have none of that tat. Rich people and crumpet over 
            sixteen can enter free: upper middle class quite welcome; lower 
            middle class not under five grand a year. Lower class - I can't 
            touch it. There's no return on it, you see. "
8,Carol Cleveland," Do you have any difficulty converting people?
            "
9,Eric Idle," Oh no, well we have ways of making them join.
            "
10,Eric Idle," Norman there does a lot of converting: a 
            lot of protection, that son of thing. And there's his mate, Bruce 
            Beer. "
11,Eric Idle," Brucie has personally converted 
            ninety-two people twenty-five inside the distance. Then again we're 
            not afraid to use more modern methods. "
12,John Cleese," Sarah, today's diocesan lovely is enough to 
            make any chap. go down on his knees. This twenty-three-year-old 
            bishop hails appropriately enough from Bishop's Stortford and lists 
            her hobbies as swimming, riding, and film producers. What a gas! Bet 
            she's no novice when it comes to converting all in her See. "
13,Michael Palin, 
14,Eric Idle, I'm starting a war for peace. 
15,Michael Palin, Cor blimey. I'm raising polecats for peace. 
16,Eric Idle," Peace? I like a peace. Know what I mean? Know what 
            I mean? Say no more. Nudge, nudge. "
17,Graham Chapman," Our religion is the first Church to cater for the 
            naughty type of person. If you'd like a bit of love-your-neighbor - 
            and who doesn't now and again - then see Vera and Ciceley during the 
            hymns. "
18,Michael Palin," In our Church we try to help people to help 
            themselves - to cars, washing machines, lead piping, no questions 
            asked. We are the only Church, apart from the Baptists, to do 
            respray jobs. "
19,Terry Jones," We the Church of. the Divine Loony believe in 
            the power of prayer to turn the head purple ha, ha, ha. "
20,John Cleese," I would like to come in here for a moment if I 
            may, and disassociate our Church from these frivolous and offensive 
            religions. We are primarily concerned with what is best... "
21,John Cleese," In our Church we believe first and foremost in you.
            "
0,John Cleese," In this picture there are forty people. None 
            of them can be seen. In this film we hope to show you how not to be 
            seen. "
1,John Cleese," In this film we hope to show how not to be 
            seen. This is Mr. E.R. Bradshaw of Napier Court, Black Lion Road 
            London SE5. He can not be seen. Now I am going to ask him to stand 
            up. Mr. Bradshaw will you stand up please "
2,John Cleese," This demonstrates the value of not being seen.
            "
3,John Cleese," In this picture we cannot see Mrs. B.J. Smegma 
            of 13, The Cresent, Belmont. Mrs. Smegma will you stand up please.
            "
4,John Cleese," This is Mr. Nesbitt of Harlow New Town. Mr. 
            Nesbit would you stand up please. "
5,John Cleese," Mr. E.V. Lambert of Homeleigh, The Burrows, 
            Oswestly, has presented us with a poser. We do not know which bush 
            he is behind, but we can soon find out. "
6,John Cleese," Mr. Ken Andrews, of Leighton Road, Slough has 
            concealed himself extremely well. He could be almost anywhere. He 
            could be behind the wall, inside the water barrel, beneath a pile of 
            leaves, up in the tree, squatting down behind the car, concealed in 
            a hollow, or crouched behind any one of a hundred bushes. However we 
            happen to know he's in the water barrel. "
7,John Cleese," Mr. and Mrs. Watson of Ivy Cottage, Worplesdon 
            Road, Hull, chose a very cunning way of not being seen. When we 
            called at their house, we found that they had gone away on two weeks 
            holiday. They had not left any forwarding address, and they had 
            bolted and barred the house to prevent us from getting in. However a 
            neighbor told us where there were. "
8,John Cleese, And here is the neighbor 
0,Michael Palin," Ah, well 'I'm afraid we have to stop the film 
            there, as some of the scenes which followed were of a violent nature 
            which might have proved distressing to some of our viewers. Though 
            not to me, I can tell you. "
0,Michael Palin,:
1,Terry Jones, 
2,Michael Palin," It should send you back to Botty with a big 
            lead. "
3,Terry Jones," Oh yes, well we're fairly confident, David.
            "
4,Michael Palin," Well at the moment, Ludovic, you're crouching 
            down inside a filing cabinet. "
5,Terry Jones," Yes that's right, David, I'm trying not to be 
            seen. "
6,Michael Palin, I see. Is this through fear? 
7,Terry Jones," Oh no, no, it's common sense really. If they 
            can't see you, they can't get you. "
8,Michael Palin," Ha, ha, ha, but of course they can still hear 
            you. "
9,Eric Idle," For those of you who may have just missed 
            'Money Python's Flying Circus', here it is again. "
0,John Cleese," (JOHN) And now for something 
            completely different... "
0,John Cleese," I will not buy this record, it is scratched."
1,Terry Jones, Sorry?
2,John Cleese," I will not buy this record, it is scratched."
3,Terry Jones," Uh, no, no, no. This is a tobacconist's."
4,John Cleese," Ah! I will not buy this *tobacconist's*, it is 
            scratched."
5,Terry Jones," No, no, no, no. Tobacco...um...cigarettes "
6,John Cleese," Ya! See-gar-ets! Ya! Uh...My hovercraft is full 
            of eels."
7,Terry Jones, Sorry?
8,John Cleese, My hovercraft 
9,Terry Jones," Ahh, matches!"
10,John Cleese," Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Do you waaaaant...do you 
            waaaaaant...to come back to my place, bouncy bouncy?"
11,Terry Jones," Here, I don't think you're using that thing right.
            "
12,John Cleese, You great poof. 
13,Terry Jones," That'll be six and six, please. "
14,John Cleese," If I said you had a beautiful body, would you 
            hold it against me? I...I am no longer infected."
15,Terry Jones," Uh, may I, uh..."
16,John Cleese, Ah. You have beautiful thighs. 
17,Terry Jones, He hit me! 
18,John Cleese," Drop your panties, Sir William; I cannot wait 
            'til lunchtime. "
19,John Cleese, 
0,Eric Idle," Good evening. Tonight is indeed a 
            unique occasion in the history of television. We are very 
            privileged, and deeply honored to have with us in the studio, Karl 
            Marx, founder of modern socialism, and author of the 'Communist 
            Manifesto'. "
1,Eric Idle, Yes it was indeed. Well challenged. 
2,Terry Gilliam, The development of the industrial bourgeoisie. 
3,Eric Idle," Yes, yes, it is indeed. You're on your way to 
            the lounge suite, Karl. Question number two. The struggle of class 
            against class is a what struggle? A what struggle? "
4,Terry Gilliam, A political struggle. 
5,Eric Idle," Yes, yes! One final question Karl and the 
            beautiful lounge suite will be yours... Are you going to have a go?
            "
6,Terry Gilliam," The workers' control of the means of production? The 
            struggle of the urban proletariat? "
7,Eric Idle," No. It was in fact, Wolverhampton Wanderers who 
            beat Leicester 3-1. "
0,Michael Palin, 
1,Michael Palin, 
2,Michael Palin, 
3,Michael Palin, 
4,Eric Idle, 
5,Michael Palin," What are you going to do when you get back to 
            Blighty? "
6,Eric Idle," I dunno, surge... I expect I'll be looking after 
            me mum. She'll be getting on a bit now. "
7,Michael Palin, Got a family of your own 'ave you? 
8,Eric Idle," No, she's ... she's all I got left now. My wife, 
            Doreen ... she ... I got a letter... "
9,Michael Palin," You don't have to tell me, son. "
10,Eric Idle," No, sarge, I'd like to tell you, see this place
            "
11,Terry Jones," Hold it. Hold it. Look, loves ... can 
            anyone not involved in this scene, please leave the set. "
12,Terry Jones," Hold it. Hold it. Now, who changed the 
            caption? Can whoever changed the caption put the right one back 
            immediately please. "
0,Michael Palin," Aren't they marvellous? The strength and 
            boldness... life and power in those colors. "
1,Eric Idle, This must be Titian's masterpiece. 
2,Michael Palin," Oh indeed - if only for the composition 
            alone. The strength of those foreground figures ... the firmness of 
            the line... "
3,Eric Idle," Yes, the confidence of the master at the 
            height of his powers. "
4,Terry Gilliam, Yes? 
5,Terry Jones," Hello sonny, your dad in.? "
6,Terry Gilliam, Yes. 
7,Terry Jones," Could I speak to him please? It's the man from 
            'The Hay Wain'. "
8,Terry Gilliam, Who? 
9,Terry Jones, The man from 'The Hay Wain' by Constable. 
10,Terry Gilliam," Dad... it's the man from 'The Hay Wain' by 
            Constable to see you. "
11,Graham Chapman, Coming. 
12,Graham Chapman, Hello? How are you? Come on in. ' 
13,Terry Jones," No, no can't stop, just passing by, actually. "
14,Graham Chapman," Oh, where are you now? "
15,Terry Jones," Well may you ask. We just been moved in next to a 
            room full of Brueghels ... terrible bloody din. Skating all hours of 
            the night. Anyway, I just dropped in to tell you there's been a 
            walk-out in the Impressionists. "
16,Graham Chapman," Walk-out, eh? "
17,Terry Jones," Yeah. It started with the 'Deieuner Sur L'Herbe' 
            lot, evidently they were moved away from above the radiator or 
            something. Anyway, the ImpresSionists are all out. Gainsborough's 
            Blue Boy's brought out the eighteenth-century English portraits, the 
            Flemish School's solid, and the German woodcuts are at a meeting 
            now. "
18,Graham Chapman," Right. Then I'll get the Renaissance School out.
            "
19,Terry Jones," OK, meeting 4.30 - 'Bridge at Aries'. "
20,Graham Chapman," OK, cheerio - good luck, son. "
21,Terry Jones, OK. 
22,Graham Chapman, Right - everybody out.

            be at a Window'? Do I hear two bob? "

1,Eric Idle," Yes, sarge? "
2,Michael Palin," What are you going to do when you get back to 
            Blighty? "
3,Eric Idle," I dunno, sarge. I expect I'll look after my mum. 
            She'll be getting on a bit now. "
4,Michael Palin, Got a family of your own have you? 
5,Eric Idle," No - she's all I got left now. My wife, Doreen 
            ... she... I got a letter. "
6,Michael Palin," You don't have to tell me, son. "
7,Eric Idle," No, sarge, I'd like to tell you. You see, this 
            bloke from up the street... "
8,Graham Chapman," OK, chaps, at ease. I've just been up the line...
            "
9,Michael Palin," Can we get through, sir? "
10,Graham Chapman," No, I'm afraid we'll have to make a break for it at 
            nightfall. "
11,Michael Palin," Right, sir. We're all with yer. "
12,Graham Chapman," Yes I know, that's just the problem, sergeant. How 
            many are there of us.? "
13,Michael Palin," Well there's you, me, Jenkins, Padre, Kipper, 
            there's five, sir. "
14,Graham Chapman, And only rations for... 
15,Michael Palin," Four, sir. "
16,Graham Chapman," Precisely. I'm afraid one of us will have to take 
            the 'other' way out. "
17,John Cleese," I'm a goner, major. Leave me, I'm ... I'm not a 
            complete man anymore. "
18,Graham Chapman, You've lost both your arms as well. 
19,John Cleese, Yes. Damn silly really. 
20,Graham Chapman," No, no, we'll draw for it. That's the way we do 
            things in the army. "
21,Michael Palin, The straws! 
22,Graham Chapman," Right now, the man who gets the shortest strain 
            knows what to do "
23,Michael Palin," Looks like you, sir. "
24,Graham Chapman," Is it? What did we say, the longest straw was it?
            "
25,Michael Palin," No, shortest, sir. "
26,Graham Chapman," Well we'd better do it again, there's obviously 
            been a bit of a muddle. "
27,Eric Idle," How about one potato, two potato, sir? "
28,Graham Chapman," Don't be childish, Jenkins. No, I think, I think 
            firsties would be best. OK, so hands behind backs. After three, OK, 
            one, two, three."
29,Michael Palin," Not stone, sir. "
30,Graham Chapman, They're very good scissors 
31,Michael Palin," No arms, sir. "
32,Graham Chapman," Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I'm afraid I didn't... tell 
            you what. All those people who don't want to stay here and shoot 
            themselves raise their arms. "
33,John Cleese," Stop it! Stop it! Stop this ... this hideous 
            facade. "
34,Michael Palin," Easy, padre! "
35,John Cleese," No; no, I must speak· When I, when I came to this 
            war, I had two arms, two good arms, but when the time came to... to 
            lose one, I .. I gave it gladly, I smiled as they cut if off, "

4,Graham Chapman," But in here we have some very nasty cases 
            indeed. "
0,Michael Palin, Good evening. First take a bunch of flowers...

1,Graham Chapman, All right.

            mornay sauce served in a Provencale manner with shallots and 
            aubergines garnished with truffle pate, brandy and with a fried egg 
            on top and spam."
8,Graham Chapman, Have you got anything without spam?
9,Terry Jones," Well, there's spam egg sausage and spam, that's 
            not got much spam in it."
10,Graham Chapman, I don't want ANY spam!
11,Eric Idle, Why can't she have egg bacon spam and sausage?
12,Graham Chapman, THAT'S got spam in it!
13,Eric Idle," Hasn't got as much spam in it as spam egg sausage and 
            spam, has it?"
14,Graham Chapman," Could you do the egg bacon spam and sausage without 
            the spam then?"
15,Terry Jones, Urgghh!
16,Graham Chapman, What do you mean 'Urgghh'? I don't like spam!
17,Terry Jones, Shut up!
18,Terry Jones, Shut up! 
19,Graham Chapman, 
20,Eric Idle," Sshh, dear, don't cause a fuss. I'll have your spam. 
            I love it. I'm having spam spam spam spam spam spam spam beaked 
            beans spam spam spam and spam!"
21,Terry Jones, Shut up!! Baked beans are off.

            then?"

3,Graham Chapman," Typical bleeding Rhondda, isn't it. You think

4,Eric Idle," You bloody fighting again. Break it up or I'll

5,Graham Chapman, He started it. 
6,Terry Jones," Oh, you bleeding pig, you started it. "
7,Eric Idle," I don't care who bloody started it. What's it

8,Terry Jones," Well ... he said the bloody Treaty of 
            Utrecht was I713. "
9,Graham Chapman, So it bloody is. 
10,Terry Jones," No it bloody isn't. It wasn't ratified 'til

11,Graham Chapman," He's bluffing. You're mind's gone, Jenkins. 
            You're rubbish. "
12,Eric Idle," He's right, Jenkins. It was ratified September 
            1713. The whole bloody pit knows that. Look in Trevelyan, page 468.

21,John Cleese, No idea. Sorry. 
22,Eric Idle, Right. Everybody out. 
0,Terry Jones," Good evening. Well, we have in the studio 
            tonight a man who says things in a very roundabout way. Isn't that 
            so, Mr. Pudifoot. "
1,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
2,Terry Jones," Have you always said things in a very 
            roundabout way? "
3,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
4,Terry Jones," Well, I can't help noticing that, for someone 
            who claims to say things in a very roundabout way, your last two 
            answers have very little of the discursive quality about them. "
5,Graham Chapman," Oh, well, I'm not very talkative today. It's 
            a form of defensive response to intensive interrogative stimuli. I 
            used to get it badly when I was a boy ... well, I say very badly, in 
            fact, do you remember when there was that fashion for, you know, 
            little poodles with small coats... "
6,Terry Jones," Ah, now you're beginning to talk in a 
            roundabout way. "
7,Graham Chapman," Oh, I'm sorry. "
8,Terry Jones," No, no, no, no. Please do carry on ... 
            because that is in fact why we wanted you on the show. "
9,Graham Chapman," I thought it was because you were interested 
            in me as a human being. "
10,Terry Jones," Well... lets move on to our guest who not 
            only lives in Essex but also speaks only the ends of words. Mr. Ohn

3,Terry Jones," Mr. Ith, don't you find it very difficult to 
            make yourself understood? "
4,Eric Idle," Yes, it is extremely difficult. "
5,Terry Jones," Just a minute, you're a fraud! "
6,Eric Idle," Oh no. I can speak the third and fourth sentences 
            perfectly normally. "
7,Terry Jones," Oh I see. So your next sentence will be only 
            the ends of words again? "
8,Eric Idle, T's... ight.

0,Eric Idle," Well last week on Fish Club we learnt how to sex a 
            pike... and this week we're going to learn how to feed a goldfish. 
            Now contrary to what most people think the goldfish has a ravenous 
            appetite. If it doesn't get enough protein it gets very thin and its 
            bones begin to stick out and its fins start to fall off. So once a 
            week give your goldfish a really good meal. Here's one specially 
            recommended by the Board of Irresponsible People. First, some cold 
            consommé or a gazpacho "
1,Ian Davidson," All right, come on, that's enough, that's 
            enough. "

2,Eric Idle," Yes I did. It's in the car. There's rather a lot.

3,John Cleese," Good, good. "
4,Eric Idle, Do you really need twelve gallons? 
5,John Cleese," No, no, not really. "
6,Eric Idle, Do you test it? 
7,John Cleese, No. 
8,Eric Idle," Well, why do you want it? "
9,John Cleese," Well, we do it to make sure that you're serious 
            about wanting insurance, I mean, if you're not, you won't spend a 
            couple of months filling up that enormous churn with mmm, so on and 
            so on... "
10,Eric Idle, Shall I bring it in? 
11,John Cleese, Good Lord no. Throw it away. 
12,Eric Idle," Throw it away? I was months filling that thing up.

            "
10,Graham Chapman," We've every facility here for dealing with 
            people who are rich. We can deal with a blocked purse, we can drain 
            private accounts and in the worst eases we can perform a total 
            cashectomy, which is total removal of all moneys from the patient.
            "
11,John Cleese," Well, here we try to help people who have to 
            link sketches together. We try to stop them saying 'Have you ever 
            wondered what it would be like if' and instead say something like 
            um... er... 'And now the mountaineering sketch'."

            O.W.A Giveaway in condemning this shoddy misrepresentation of our 
            modern navy. The British Navy is one of the finest and most 
            attractive and butchest fighting forces in the world. I love those 
            white flared trousers and the feel of rough blue serge on those pert 
            little buttocks... "

20,Michael Palin, Thirty-three days? 
21,Graham Chapman," We can't go on much longer, sir. We haven't

23,Michael Palin," Shut up, Morley. "

25,Terry Jones," How we feeling, Captain? "
26,John Cleese, Not too good. I...I feel so weak. 
27,Graham Chapman, We can't hold out much longer. 
28,John Cleese," Listen...chaps...there's still a chance. 
            I'm...done for, I've...got a gamy leg and I'm going fast; I'll never 
            get through. But...some of you might. So...you'd better eat me. "
29,Michael Palin," Eat you, sir? "
30,John Cleese, Yes. Eat me. 
31,Graham Chapman, Ewwww! With a gamy leg? 
32,John Cleese," You didn't eat the leg, Thompson. There's still 
            plenty of good meat. Look at that arm. "
33,Eric Idle," It's not just the leg, sir. "
34,John Cleese, What do you mean? 
35,John Cleese," Well, sir...it's just that - "
36,John Cleese, Why don't you want to eat me? 
37,Eric Idle," I'd rather eat Johnson, sir! "
38,Graham Chapman," So would I, sir. "
39,John Cleese, I see. 
40,Terry Jones," Well that's settled then...everyone's gonna eat 
            me!"
41,Michael Palin," Uh, well. "
42,John Cleese," What, sir? "
43,Michael Palin,": No, no you go ahead, please, I won't......."
44,Terry Jones," Oh nonsense, sir, you're starving; ducking. "
45,Michael Palin," No, no, it's not that. "
46,Graham Chapman," What's the matter with Johnson, sir?"
47,Michael Palin," Well, he's not kosher. "
48,Eric Idle," That depends how we kill him, sir. "
49,Michael Palin," Yes, that's true. But to be perfectly frank 
            I...I like my meat a little more lean. I'd rather eat Hodges."
50,Graham Chapman," Oh well, all right."
51,John Cleese, I still prefer Johnson.
52,John Cleese, I wish you'd all stop bickering and eat me.
53,Graham Chapman," Look. I tell you what. Those who want to can 
            eat Johnson. And you, sir, can have my leg. And we make some stock 
            from the Captain, and then we'll have Johnson cold for supper."
54,Michael Palin," Good thinking, Hodges."
55,Terry Jones, And we'll finish off with the peaches. 
56,Eric Idle, And we can start off with the avocados. 
57,Michael Palin, Waitress! 
0,John Cleese, 
1,Graham Chapman," Yup, that's right, what can I do for you, 
            squire?"
2,John Cleese," Um, well, I wonder if you can help me. My mother has 
            just died and I'm not quite sure what I should do."
3,Graham Chapman," Ah, well, we can 'elp you. We deal with 
            stiffs."
4,John Cleese, 
5,Graham Chapman," Yea. Now there's three things we can do with 
            your mum. We can bury her, burn her, or dump her."
6,John Cleese, Dump her?
7,Graham Chapman, Dump her in the Thames.
8,John Cleese, 
9,Graham Chapman," Oh, did you like her?"
10,John Cleese, Yes!
11,Graham Chapman," Oh well, we won't dump her, then. Well, what 
            do you think: burn her, or bury her?"
12,John Cleese," Um, well, um, which would you recommend?"
13,Graham Chapman," Well they're both nasty. If we burn her, she 
            gets stuffed in the flames, crackle, crackle, crackle, which is a 
            bit of a shock if she's not quite dead. But quick. And then you get 
            a box of ashes, which you can pretend are hers."
14,John Cleese, 
15,Graham Chapman," Or, if you don't wanna fry her, you can bury 
            her. And then she'll get eaten up by maggots and weevils, nibble, 
            nibble, nibble, which isn't so hot if, as I said, she's not quite 
            dead."
16,John Cleese," I see. Um. Well, I.. I.. I.. I'm not very sure. She's 
            definitely dead."
17,Graham Chapman, Where is she?
18,John Cleese, In the sack.
19,Graham Chapman, Let's 'ave a look.
20,Graham Chapman," Umm, she looks quite young."
21,John Cleese," Yes, she was."
22,Graham Chapman, 
23,Eric Idle, 
24,Graham Chapman, I THINK WE'VE GOT AN EATER!
25,Eric Idle, I'll get the oven on!
26,John Cleese," Um, er...excuse me, um, are you... are you suggesting 
            we should eat my mother?"
27,Graham Chapman," Yeah. Not raw, not raw. We cook her. She'd be 
            delicious with a few french fries, a bit of stuffing. Delicious! "
28,John Cleese, What! 
29,John Cleese," Actually, I do feel a bit peckish - No! NO, I can't!"
30,Graham Chapman," Look, we'll eat your mum. Then, if you feel a 
            bit guilty about it afterwards, we can dig a grave and you can throw 
            up into it."
31,John Cleese, All right.
