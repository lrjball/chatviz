0,Terry Jones," Ah - good evening everyone, and welcome to the 
            second of our Italian language classes, in which we'll be helping 
            you brush up your Italian. Last week we started at the beginning, 
            and we learnt the Italian for a 'spoon'. Now, I wonder how many of 
            you can remember what it was? ",1969-10-05 05:59:26

5,Terry Jones," Well, now, this week we're going to learn some 
            useful phrases to help us open a conversation with an Italian. Now 
            first of all try telling him where you come from. For example, I 
            would say: 'Sono Inglese di Gerrard's Cross', I am an Englishman 
            from Gerrard's Cross. Shall we all try that together? ",1969-10-05 08:16:51

0,Eric Idle," And now for more news of the momentous artistic 
            event in which Pablo Picasso is doing a specially commissioned 
            painting for us whilst riding a bicycle. Pablo Picasso - the founder 
            of modern art - without doubt the greatest abstract painter ever... 
            for the first time painting in motion. But first of all let's have a 
            look at the route he'll be taking. ",1969-10-09 06:51:20
1,Michael Palin," Well Picasso will be starting, David, at 
            Chichester here, he'll then cycle on the A29 to Fontwell, he'll then 
            take the A272 which will bring him on to the A3 just north of 
            Hindhead here. From then on Pablo has a straight run on the A3 until 
            he meets the South Circular at Battersea here. Well, this is a truly 
            remarkable occasion as it is the first time that a modern artist of 
            such stature has taken the A272, and it'll be very interesting to 
            see how he copes with the heavy traffic round Wisborough Green. 
            Vicky. ",1969-10-09 07:05:16
2,Eric Idle," Well Picasso will be riding his Viking Super 
            Roadster with the drop handlebars and the dual-thread wheel-rims and 
            with his Wiley-Prat 20-1 synchro-mesh he should experience 
            difficulties on the sort of road surfaces they just don't get 
            abroad. Mitzie. ",1969-10-09 12:30:20
3,Eric Idle," And now for the latest report on Picasso's 
            progress over to Reg Moss on the Guildford by-pass. ",1969-10-09 13:03:49
4,Eric Idle," Well there's no sign of Picasso at the moment, David. 
            But he should be through here at any moment. However I do have Geppo 
            with me, Mr. Ron Geppo, British Cycling Sprint Champion and this 
            year's winner of the Derby-Doncaster rally. ",1969-10-09 13:17:36

            sign of Picasso, so I'll hand you back to the studio. ",1969-10-09 14:08:29

10,John Cleese," (excited) Good lord, you're right. It's Kandinsky. 
            Wassily Kandinsky, and who's this here with him? It's Braque. 
            Georges Braque, the Cubist, painting a bird in flight over a 
            cornfield and going very fast down the hill towards Kingston and...

            Ewhurst, trying to get a short cut through to Dorking via Peaslake 
            and Goreshall. Well, Picasso is reported to be unhurt, but the pig 
            has a slight headache. And on that note we must say goodnight to 
            you. Picasso has failed in his first bid for international cycling 
            fame. So from all of us here at the 'It's the Arts' studio, it's

            safety. One of them saw two words of the joke and spent several 
            weeks in hospital· But apart from that things went pretty quickly,

0,Terry Jones," Mrs. Potter - you knew Harold Potter quite well 
            I believe? ",1969-11-18 19:55:21
1,Eric Idle, Oh yes quite well. ,1969-11-18 20:28:21
2,Terry Jones, Yes. ,1969-11-18 21:17:29
3,Eric Idle, He was my husband. ,1969-11-18 21:28:55
4,Terry Jones," Yes. And, er, he never showed any inclination 
            towards being a Scotsman before this happened? ",1969-11-18 22:48:36
5,Eric Idle, ,1969-11-19 01:34:49
6,Terry Jones, He didn't wear a kilt or play the bagpipes? ,1969-11-19 01:54:49
7,Eric Idle," No, no. ",1969-11-19 02:31:41
8,Terry Jones," He never got drunk at night or bought home 
            black puddings? ",1969-11-19 03:23:55
9,Eric Idle," No, no. Not at all. ",1969-11-19 04:01:02
10,Terry Jones," He didn't have an inadequate brain capacity?
            ",1969-11-19 04:10:57
11,Eric Idle," No, no, not at all. ",1969-11-19 05:06:43
12,Terry Jones," I see. So by your account Harold Potter was a 
            perfectly ordinary Englishman without any tendency towards being a 
            Scotsman whatsoever? ",1969-11-19 05:43:02
13,Eric Idle," Absolutely, yes. ",1969-11-19 05:54:58
14,Terry Jones," Ah-hah! ... Well that's it, you see. That's how 
            it starts. ",1969-11-19 06:36:01
15,Eric Idle, I beg your pardon? ,1969-11-19 06:43:26
16,Terry Jones," Well you see Scottishness staffs with little 
            things like that, and works up. You see, people don't just turn into 
            a Scotsman for no reason at all... ",1969-11-19 07:39:31
18,Graham Chapman, Darling... ,1969-11-19 08:46:10
20,Graham Chapman," Darling, darling... ",1969-11-19 11:16:58
22,Graham Chapman, What is it darling? ,1969-11-19 18:08:04
24,Graham Chapman, What! Mr. Llewellyn? ,1969-11-19 19:06:22
26,Graham Chapman, But what can I do? ,1969-11-19 23:51:14
28,Graham Chapman, So I am! ,1969-11-20 04:26:53
30,Graham Chapman," Now first of all, why would anyone turn into a 
            Scotsman? ",1969-11-20 05:10:14
32,Graham Chapman," No, no! Only because he has no control over his 
            own destiny! Look I'll show you... ",1969-11-20 06:03:30
34,Graham Chapman," Yes! So this means that some person or persons 
            unknown is turning all these people into Scotsmen... ",1969-11-20 06:42:25
36,Graham Chapman," I don't know ... I don't know ... all I know is 
            that these people are streaming north of the border at the rate of 
            thousands every hour. If we don't act fast, Scotland will be choked 
            with Scotsmen... ",1969-11-20 07:24:39
38,John Cleese," Soon Scotland was full of Scotsmen. The 
            over-crowding was pitiful. ",1969-11-20 07:57:18
39,John Cleese, Three men to a caber. ,1969-11-20 09:34:05
40,John Cleese," For the few who remained, life was 
            increasingly difficult. ",1969-11-20 11:12:25
42,Graham Chapman, Hello mummy. ,1969-11-20 13:41:53
44,Graham Chapman, Oh how horrible... Will they stop at nothing? ,1969-11-20 15:44:11
46,Graham Chapman, I meant that rhetorically. ,1969-11-20 19:55:31
48,Graham Chapman," It means, I didn't expect an answer. ",1969-11-20 22:43:39
50,Graham Chapman, Did mummy say anything as she changed? ,1969-11-20 23:08:05
52,Graham Chapman," Well, what was it? ",1969-11-21 00:18:49
54,Graham Chapman," No ... It's just the incidental music for this 
            scene. ",1969-11-21 05:41:36
56,Graham Chapman, 'Them' ... Wait a minute! ,1969-11-21 06:42:24
58,Graham Chapman," No, I meant that metaphorically ... 'Them' ... 
            'Them' ... She was obviously referring to the people who turned her 
            into a Scotsman. If only we knew who 'They' were ... And why 'They' 
            were doing it... Who are 'Them'? ",1969-11-21 07:40:22
59,John Cleese," Then suddenly a clue turned up in 
            Scotland. Mr. Angus Podgorny, owner of a Dunbar menswear shop, 
            received an order for 48,000,000 'kilts from the planet Skyron in 
            the Galaxy of Andromeda. ",1969-11-21 09:33:37
60,Terry Jones," Angus how are y'going to get 48,000,000 
            kilts into the van? ",1969-11-21 10:31:35
61,Michael Palin, I'll have t'do it in two goes. ,1969-11-21 11:17:33
62,Terry Jones," D'you not ken that the Galaxy of Andromeda 
            is two million, two hundred thousand light years away? ",1969-11-21 11:28:37
63,Michael Palin, Is that so? ,1969-11-21 13:37:42
64,Terry Jones," Aye ... and you've never been further than 
            Berwick-on-Tweed... ",1969-11-21 14:09:04
65,Michael Palin," Aye ... but think o' the money dear ... £18.10.0d a 
            kilt ...that's ... ",1969-11-21 15:07:27
66,Terry Jones," Aye ... I think you ought not to go, Angus.
            ",1969-11-21 15:21:37
67,Michael Palin, ,1969-11-21 16:30:19
68,Terry Jones," Aye . . but he hasn't signed the order yet, 
            has he? ",1969-11-21 17:12:02
69,Michael Palin, Who? ,1969-11-21 20:34:58
70,Terry Jones, Ach ... the man from Andromeda. ,1969-11-21 21:20:08
71,Michael Palin," Och ... well ... he wasna really a man, d'you ken 
            ... ",1969-11-21 21:24:16
72,Terry Jones, ,1969-11-21 22:02:40
73,Michael Palin, ,1969-11-21 22:59:09
74,Terry Jones," Angus Podgorny, what do y'mean? ",1969-11-21 23:57:10
75,Michael Palin, He wasna so much a man as... a blancmange! ,1969-11-22 01:51:10
76,John Cleese," A blancmange, eh? ",1969-11-22 01:53:28
77,Eric Idle," Yes, that's fight. I was just having a game of 
            doubles with Sandra and Jocasta, Alec and David... ",1969-11-22 02:04:55
78,John Cleese, Hang on! ,1969-11-22 02:06:08
79,Eric Idle, What? ,1969-11-22 02:23:31
80,John Cleese, There's five. ,1969-11-22 03:14:22
81,Eric Idle, What? ,1969-11-22 03:36:25
82,John Cleese," Five people . . . how do you play doubles with 
            five people? ",1969-11-22 04:28:01
83,Eric Idle," Ah, well ... we were... ",1969-11-22 05:39:53
84,John Cleese," Sounds a bit funny if you ask me ... playing 
            doubles with five people... ",1969-11-22 07:07:09
85,Eric Idle," Well we often play like that... Jocasta plays on the 
            side receiving service... ",1969-11-22 07:17:12
86,John Cleese, Oh yes? ,1969-11-22 07:48:23
87,Eric Idle," Yes. It helps to speed the game up and make it a lot 
            faster, and it means Jocasta isn't left out. ",1969-11-22 08:14:52
88,John Cleese," Look, are you asking me to believe that the five 
            of you was playing doubles, when on the very next court there was a 
            blancmange playing by itself?. ",1969-11-22 10:17:48
89,Eric Idle," That's right, yes. ",1969-11-22 10:21:10
90,John Cleese," Well answer me this then - why didn't Jocasta 
            play the blancmange at singles, while you and Sandra and Alec and 
            David had a proper game of doubles with four people? ",1969-11-22 14:18:48
91,Eric Idle," Because Jocasta always plays with us. She's a friend 
            of ours. ",1969-11-22 14:39:38
92,John Cleese," Call that friendship? Messing up a perfectly 
            good game of doubles? ",1969-11-22 14:40:35
93,Eric Idle," It's not messing it up, officer, we like to play 
            with five. ",1969-11-22 14:45:41
94,John Cleese," Look it's your affair if you want to play with 
            five people ... but don't go calling it doubles. Look at Wimbledon, 
            fight? If Fred Stolle and Tony Roche played Charlie Pasarell and 
            Cliff Drysdale and Peaches Bartcowitz... they wouldn't go calling it 
            doubles. ",1969-11-22 16:40:13
95,Eric Idle, But what about the blancmange? ,1969-11-22 17:06:04
96,John Cleese," That could play Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband 
            Pip. ",1969-11-22 17:48:05
97,Terry Jones," Oh, a blancmange gave you an order for 
            48,000,000 kilts? ",1969-11-22 19:39:05
98,Michael Palin, Aye! ,1969-11-22 20:50:20
99,Terry Jones, And you believed it? ,1969-11-22 22:20:01
100,Michael Palin," Aye, I did. ",1969-11-22 22:24:06
101,Terry Jones," Och, you're a stupid man, Angus Podgorny.
            ",1969-11-23 00:26:54
102,Michael Palin, ,1969-11-23 01:02:06
103,Terry Jones, Even if it's from a blancmange? ,1969-11-23 01:05:04
104,Michael Palin," Och, woman, if a blancmange is prepared to come 
            2,200,000 light years to purchase a kilt, they must be fairly keen 
            on kilts. So cease yer prattling woman and get sewing. This could be 
            the biggest breakthrough in kilts since the Provost of Edinburgh sat 
            on a spike. Mary, we'll be rich! We'll be rich! ",1969-11-23 01:18:38
105,Terry Jones," Oh, but Angus... he hasna given you an 
            earnest of his good faith! ",1969-11-23 01:50:29
106,Michael Palin, Ah mebbe not but he has gi' me this... ,1969-11-23 02:24:05
107,Terry Jones, What is it now? ,1969-11-23 02:24:56
108,Michael Palin," An entry form for the British Open Tennis 
            Championships at Wimbledon Toon ... signed and seconded. ",1969-11-23 03:27:54
109,Terry Jones," Och, but ",1969-11-23 03:47:42
110,Michael Palin," Aye, but I must go though dear, I dinna want to 
            seem ungrateful. ",1969-11-23 04:03:52
111,Terry Jones," Ach! Angus, I wilna let you make a fool 
            o'yoursel'. ",1969-11-23 04:48:22
112,Michael Palin, But I must. ,1969-11-23 05:51:53
113,Terry Jones," Och, no you'll not ... ",1969-11-23 07:07:35
114,Michael Palin," Oh, Mary... ",1969-11-23 07:52:44
115,Terry Jones, Urrgh. It's the blancmange. ,1969-11-23 08:37:11
116,Graham Chapman," Oh, now this is where Mr. Podgorny could have 
            saved his wife's life. If he'd gone to the police and told them that 
            he'd been approached by unearthly beings from the Galaxy of 
            Andromeda, we'd have sent a man round to investigate. As it was he 
            did a deal with a blancmange, and the blancmange ate his wife. So if 
            you're going out, or going on holiday, or anything strange happens 
            involving other galaxies, just nip round to your local police 
            station, and tell the sergeant on duty - or his wife - of your 
            suspicions. And the same goes for dogs. So I'm sorry to have 
            interrupted your exciting science fiction story ... but, then, 
            crime's our business you know. So carry on viewing, and my thanks to 
            the BBC for allowing me to have this little chat with you. 
            Goodnight. God bless, look after yourselves. ",1969-11-23 08:46:10
117,Eric Idle, ,1969-11-23 09:15:37
118,Michael Palin," Aye ... I'll ... do ... my best, sergeant. ",1969-11-23 10:26:57
119,Eric Idle, ,1969-11-23 11:05:46
120,Michael Palin," Er, detective inspector. ",1969-11-23 11:24:31
121,Eric Idle, ,1969-11-23 12:07:16
122,Michael Palin," Yes, sir. ",1969-11-23 12:21:52
123,Eric Idle, Are you mad? ,1969-11-23 12:37:05
124,Michael Palin," No, sir. ",1969-11-23 12:46:01
125,Eric Idle," Well that's a relief. 'Cos if you were, your 
            story would be less plausible. ",1969-11-23 13:26:12
126,Michael Palin, ,1969-11-23 14:09:04
127,Eric Idle," Good. His name's Riley... Jack Riley... He's 
            that most rare of criminals ... a blancmange impersonator and 
            cannibal. ",1969-11-23 14:58:29
128,Michael Palin," But what about the 48,000,000 kilts and the Galaxy 
            of Andromeda? ",1969-11-23 15:20:22
129,Eric Idle," I'm afraid that's just one of his stories. You 
            must understand that a blancmange impersonator and cannibal has to 
            use some pretty clever stories to allay suspicion. ",1969-11-23 15:29:33
130,Michael Palin, Then you mean... ,1969-11-23 15:31:55
131,Eric Idle, Yes. ,1969-11-23 15:36:52
132,Michael Palin, But... ,1969-11-23 16:25:36
133,Eric Idle, How? ,1969-11-23 16:49:10
134,Michael Palin, Yes. ,1969-11-23 17:34:58
135,Eric Idle, Well... ,1969-11-23 17:37:44
136,Michael Palin, Not? ,1969-11-23 20:10:24
137,Eric Idle, I'm afraid so. ,1969-11-23 20:51:32
138,Michael Palin, Why? ,1969-11-23 21:00:14
139,Eric Idle, Who knows? ,1969-11-23 21:28:25
140,Michael Palin, Do you think? ,1969-11-23 21:38:39
141,Eric Idle, Could be. ,1969-11-24 00:05:31
142,Michael Palin, But... ,1969-11-24 00:17:35
143,Eric Idle, I know. ,1969-11-24 00:37:19
144,Michael Palin, She was... ,1969-11-24 01:32:36
145,Eric Idle, Yes. ,1969-11-24 01:53:04
146,Eric Idle, Good lord what's that? ,1969-11-24 02:41:11
147,Eric Idle, It's an extra-terrestrial being! Agggh! ,1969-11-24 03:57:17
148,Graham Chapman," So, everyone in England is being turned into 
            Scotsmen, right? ",1969-11-24 04:35:46
150,Graham Chapman," Now, which is the wont tennis-playing nation in 
            the world? ",1969-11-24 05:37:58

            ",1969-11-24 09:06:03
158,Graham Chapman, No! Scotland! ,1969-11-24 09:42:21
160,Graham Chapman," Now ... now these blancmanges, apart from the one 
            that killed ",1969-11-24 11:06:03
161,Terry Jones," have all appeared in which London suburb?
            ",1969-11-24 11:52:58
163,Graham Chapman," No. Wimbledon ... Now do you begin to see the 
            pattern? With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated? ",1969-11-24 14:41:50
164,Terry Jones, ,1969-11-24 18:07:56
165,Graham Chapman," With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated?
            ",1969-11-24 18:46:06
167,Graham Chapman, No. ,1969-11-24 20:47:20
168,Graham Chapman," No. Wimbledon is most commonly associated with 
            tennis. ",1969-11-24 23:58:02
170,Graham Chapman," Yes, it all falls into place! ",1969-11-25 00:40:49
172,Graham Chapman, ,1969-11-25 01:43:48
173,Graham Chapman," Yes. So these blancmanges, blancmange-shaped 
            creatures come from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda. 
            They order 48,000,000 kilts from a Scottish menswear shop ... turn 
            the population of England into Scotsmen (well known as the worst 
            tennis-playing nation on Earth) thus leaving England empty during 
            Wimbledon fortnight! Empty during Wimbledon fortnight ... what's 
            more the papers are full of reports of blancmanges appearing on 
            tennis courts up and down the country - practicing. This can only 
            mean one thing! ",1969-11-25 02:45:53
174,Graham Chapman, They mean to win Wimbledon. Jarring chord.,1969-11-25 02:52:22
0,Eric Idle," Well, here at Wimbledon, it's been a most 
            extraordinary week's tennis. The blancmanges have swept the board, 
            winning match after match. Here are just a few of the results: 
            Billie-Jean King eaten in straight sets, Laver smothered whole after 
            winning the first set, and Poncho Gonzales, serving as well as I've 
            never seen him, with some superb volleys and decisive return volleys 
            off the back hand, was sucked through the net at match point and 
            swallowed whole in just under two minutes. And so, here on the final 
            day, there seems to be no players left to challenge the blancmanges. 
            And this could be their undoing, Dan: as the rules of Wimbledon 
            state quite clearly that there must be at least one human being 
            concerned in the final. ",1969-11-25 03:00:01
1,Eric Idle," And it's blancmange to serve and it's 
            a good one. ",1969-11-25 03:17:51
2,Eric Idle," And Podgorny fails to even hit 
                the ball ... but this is no surprise as he hasn't hit the ball 
                once throughout this match. So it's 72 match points to the

39,John Cleese," Well you two are, and we've got a brace of guides 
            called Jimmy Blenkinsop... because Kilimanjaro is a pretty tricky 
            climb you know, most of it's up until you reach the very very top, 
            and then it tends to slope away rather sharply. But Jimmy's put his 
            heads together and worked out a way up. ",1969-12-07 21:30:55

            ... I hate cutting hair. I have this terrible un-un-uncontrollable 
            fear whenever I see hair. When I was a kid I used to hate the sight 
            of hair being cut. My mother said I was a fool. She said the only 
            cure for it was to become a barber. So I spent five ghastly years at 
            the Hairdressers' Training Centre at Totnes. Can you imagine what 
            it's like cutting the same head for five years? I didn't want to be 
            a barber anyway. I wanted to be a lumberjack. Leaping from tree to 
            tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia . . .

            life. Hunting, shooting, fishing. Getting out there with a gun,

            Friend, ha, ha, ha. Well, let's see what we've got next. In a few 
            moments, 'It's a Tree', and in the chair as usual is Arthur Tree, 
            and starring in the show will be a host of star guests as his guest 
            stars, and then, at 9.30, we've got another rollicking half-hour of 
            laughter-packed squalor with 'Yes, It's the Sewage Farm Attendants'. 
            And this week, Dan falls into a vat of human dung with hilarious 
            consequences. Ha, ha, ha. But now, it's the glittering world of show 
            business with Arthur Tree.",1969-12-14 07:46:23
1,Eric Idle," Hello. Hello people, and welcome to 'It's a 
            Tree'. We have some really exciting guests for you this evening: a 
            fabulous spruce, back from a tour of Holland; three gum trees making 
            their first appearance in this country; Scots pine and the conifers, 
            and Elm Tree Bole... there you go; can't be bad... an exciting new 
            American plank, a rainforest and a bucket of sawdust giving their 
            views on teenage violence, and an unusual guest for this program, a 
            piece of laminated plastic. ",1969-12-14 08:25:26
2,Eric Idle," But first, will you please, please welcome... 
            a block of wood! ",1969-12-14 09:25:19
3,Eric Idle," Well, Block, nice to have you on the show 
            again.",1969-12-14 10:08:40
4,John Cleese," Well, er, thanks, Tree. I've got to pay the 
            rent.",1969-12-14 10:17:12
5,Eric Idle, (laughing),1969-12-14 13:10:03
6,Eric Idle," Ha, ha, ha, ha. Super. Well, what have you 
            been doing, Block? ",1969-12-14 14:17:30
7,John Cleese," Well, I've just been starring in several 
            major multi-million dollar international films, and, during breaks 
            on the set, I've been designing a cathedral, doing unpublicized work 
            for charity, er, finishing my history of the world, of course, 
            pulling the birds, er, photographing royalty on the loo, averting 
            World War Three... can't be bad... and, er, learning to read.",1969-12-14 14:22:38
8,Eric Idle," The full Renaissance bit, really. Super. 
            Super. Well, I've got to stop you there, Block, I'm afraid, because 
            we've got someone who's been doing cabaret in the New Forest. From 
            America, will you please welcome a Chippendale writing desk!",1969-12-14 14:39:25
0,John Cleese, Ah Mr. Anchovy. Do sit down. ,1969-12-14 15:27:31
1,Michael Palin," Thank you. Take the weight off the feet, eh? ",1969-12-14 15:45:03
2,John Cleese,:,1969-12-14 15:57:31
3,Michael Palin," Lovely weather for the time of year, I must say.
            ",1969-12-14 17:07:11
4,John Cleese," Enough of this gay banter. And now Mr. Anchovy, 
            you asked us to advise you which job in life you were best suited 
            for. ",1969-12-14 17:46:39
5,Michael Palin," That is correct, yes. ",1969-12-14 18:17:22
6,John Cleese," Well I now have the results here of the 
            interviews and the aptitude tests that you took last week, and from 
            them we've built up a pretty clear picture of the sort of person 
            that you are. And 1 think I can say, without fear of contradiction, 
            that the ideal job for you is chartered accountancy. ",1969-12-14 18:43:48
7,Michael Palin, But I am a chartered accountant. ,1969-12-14 19:27:04
8,John Cleese," Jolly good. Well back to the office with you 
            then. ",1969-12-14 19:56:18
9,Michael Palin," No! No! No! You don't understand. I've been a 
            chartered accountant for the last twenty years. I want a new job. 
            Something exciting that will let me live. ",1969-12-14 20:08:53
10,John Cleese," Well chartered accountancy is rather exciting 
            isn't it? ",1969-12-14 20:10:42
11,Michael Palin," Exciting? No it's not. It's dull. Dull. Dull. My 
            God it's dull, it's so desperately dull and tedious and stuffy and 
            boring and des-per-ate-ly DULL. ",1969-12-14 20:50:25
12,John Cleese," Well, er, yes Mr. Anchovy, but you see your 
            report here says that you are an extremely dull person. You see, our 
            experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow, unimaginative, 
            timid, lacking in initiative, spineless, easily dominated, no sense 
            of humor, tedious company and irrepressibly drab and awful. And 
            whereas in most professions these would be considerable drawbacks, 
            in chartered accountancy they are a positive boon. ",1969-12-14 21:53:04
13,Michael Palin," But don't you see, I came here to find a new job, 
            a new life, a new meaning to my existence. Can't you help me? ",1969-12-14 23:34:25
14,John Cleese," Well, do you have any idea of what you want to 
            do? ",1969-12-15 00:41:01
15,Michael Palin," Yes, yes I have. ",1969-12-15 01:21:59
16,John Cleese, What? ,1969-12-15 01:30:12
17,Michael Palin, (boldly) Lion taming. ,1969-12-15 02:11:43
18,John Cleese," Well yes. Yes. Of course, it's a bit of a jump 
            isn't it? I mean, er, chartered accountancy to lion taming in one 
            go. You don't think it might be better if you worked your way 
            towards lion taming, say, via banking'... ",1969-12-15 02:13:44
19,Michael Palin," No, no, no, no. No. I don't want to wait. At nine 
            o'clock tomorrow I want to be in there, taming. ",1969-12-15 02:37:16
20,John Cleese," Fine, fine. But do you, do you have any 
            qualifications? ",1969-12-15 02:59:51
21,Michael Palin," Yes, I've got a hat. ",1969-12-15 03:43:55
22,John Cleese, A hat? ,1969-12-15 04:16:52
23,Michael Palin," 'Yes, a hat. A lion taming hat. A hat with 'lion 
            tamer' on it. I got it at Harrods. And it lights up saying 'lion 
            tamer' in great big neon letters, so that you can tame them after 
            dark when they're less stroppy. ",1969-12-15 05:13:36
24,John Cleese," I see, I see. ",1969-12-15 05:54:50
25,Michael Palin," And you can switch it off during the day time, 
            and claim reasonable wear and tear as allowable professional 
            expenses under paragraph 335C... ",1969-12-15 05:55:38
26,John Cleese," Yes, yes, yes, I do follow, Mr. Anchovy, but 
            you see the snag is... if I now call Mr. Chipperfield and say to 
            him, 'look here, I've got a forty-five-year-old chartered accountant 
            with me who wants to become a lion tamer', his first question is not 
            going to be 'does he have his own hat?' He's going to ask what sort 
            of experience you've had with lions. ",1969-12-15 06:25:28
27,Michael Palin, Well I ... I've seen them at the zoo. ,1969-12-15 07:14:59
28,John Cleese," Good, good, good. ",1969-12-15 07:33:10
29,Michael Palin," Lively brown furry things with short stumpy legs 
            and great long noses. I don't know what all the fuss is about, I 
            could tame one of those. They look pretty tame to start with. ",1969-12-15 08:21:10
30,John Cleese," And these, er, these lions ... how high are 
            they? ",1969-12-15 08:57:10
31,Michael Palin, ,1969-12-15 09:20:48
32,John Cleese, Really. And do these lions eat ants? ,1969-12-15 09:20:53
33,Michael Palin," Yes, that's right. ",1969-12-15 09:51:17
34,John Cleese," Er, well, Mr. Anchovy ... I'm afraid what 
            you've got hold of there is an anteater. ",1969-12-15 09:53:43
35,Michael Palin, A what? ,1969-12-15 10:15:29
36,John Cleese," An anteater. Not a lion. You see a lion is a 
            huge savage beast, about five feet high, ten feet long, weighing 
            about four hundred pounds, running forty miles per hour, with masses 
            of sharp pointed teeth and nasty long razor-sharp claws that can rip 
            your belly open before you can say 'Eric Robinson', and they look 
            like this. ",1969-12-15 11:16:18
37,John Cleese, Time enough I think for a piece of wood. ,1969-12-15 12:15:23
38,Terry Jones, The larch. ,1969-12-15 12:36:42
39,John Cleese," Now, shall I call Mr. Chipperfield? ",1969-12-15 13:52:19
40,Michael Palin," Er, no, no, no. I think your idea of making the 
            transition to lion taming via easy stages, say via insurance... ",1969-12-15 14:56:18
41,John Cleese, Or banking. ,1969-12-15 15:06:33
42,Michael Palin," Or banking, yes, yes, banking that's a man's 
            life, isn't it? Banking, travel, excitement, adventure, thrills, 
            decisions affecting people's lives. ",1969-12-15 16:08:22
43,John Cleese," Jolly good, well, er, shall I put you in touch 
            with a bank? ",1969-12-15 16:55:48
44,Michael Palin, Yes. ,1969-12-15 17:30:55
45,John Cleese, Fine. ,1969-12-15 18:03:12
46,Michael Palin," Er... no, no, no. Look, er, it's a big decision, 
            I'd like a couple of weeks to think about it... er... you know, 
            don't want to jump into it too quickly. Maybe three weeks. I could 
            let you know definitely then, I just don't want to make this 
            definite decision. I'm er... ",1969-12-15 18:23:34
47,John Cleese, ,1969-12-15 18:50:55
49,Terry Jones," No it wasn't, you fairy. ",1969-12-15 19:35:00
51,Terry Jones," Here, you wouldn't have got on one of our voyages 
            - they were all dead butch. ",1969-12-15 20:28:43
0,Eric Idle," There is an epic quality about the sea which 
            has throughout history stirred the hearts and minds of Englishmen of 
            all nations. Sir Francis Drake, Captain Webb, Nelson of Trafalgar 
            and Scott of the Antarctic - all rose to the challenge of the mighty 
            ocean. And today another Englishman may add his name to the golden 
            roll of history: Mr. Ron Obvious of Neaps End. For today, Ron 
            Obvious hopes to be the first man to jump the Channel· ",1969-12-15 23:45:55
1,John Cleese," Ron, now let's just get this quite clear - 
            you're intending to jump across the English Channel? ",1969-12-16 01:54:26
2,Terry Jones," Oh yes, that is correct, yes. ",1969-12-16 04:17:06
3,John Cleese," And, er, just how far is that? ",1969-12-16 04:36:28
4,Terry Jones," Oh, well it's twenty-six miles from here to Calais.
            ",1969-12-16 05:20:33
5,John Cleese," Er, that's to the beach at Calais? ",1969-12-16 05:51:49
6,Terry Jones," Well, no, no, provided I get a good lift off and 
            maybe a gust of breeze over the French coast, I shall be jumping 
            into the centre of Calais itself. ",1969-12-16 07:13:33
7,John Cleese," Ron are you using any special techniques to 
            jump this great distance? ",1969-12-16 07:43:25
8,Terry Jones," Oh no, no. I shall be using an ordinary two-footed 
            jump, er, straight up in the air and across the Channel. ",1969-12-16 08:29:41
9,John Cleese," I see. Er, Ron, what is the furthest distance 
            that you've jumped, er, so far? ",1969-12-16 09:05:26
10,Terry Jones," Er, oh, eleven foot six inches at Motspur Park on 
            July 22nd. Er, but I have done nearly twelve feet unofficially. ",1969-12-16 09:22:47
11,John Cleese," I see. Er, Ron, Ron, Ron, aren't you worried 
            Ron, aren't you worried jumping twenty-six miles across the sea? ",1969-12-16 10:06:54
12,Terry Jones," Oh, well no, no, no, no. It is in fact easier to jump 
            over sea than over dry land. ",1969-12-16 11:37:29
13,John Cleese, Well how is that? ,1969-12-16 12:56:34
14,Terry Jones," Er, well my manager explained it to me. You see if 
            you're five miles out over the English Channel, with nothing but sea 
            underneath you, er, there is a very great impetus to say in the air.
            ",1969-12-16 15:17:01
15,John Cleese," I see. Well, er, thank you very much Ron and 
            the very best of luck. ",1969-12-16 15:42:12

18,Michael Palin, What? ,1969-12-16 16:47:56
19,John Cleese," Er, no, we're from the BBC, Mr. Vercotti. ",1969-12-16 20:21:18
20,Michael Palin, Who? ,1969-12-16 20:58:21
21,John Cleese, The BBC. ,1969-12-16 22:23:47
22,Michael Palin," Oh, oh. I see. I thought, I thought you were 
            the er . .. I like the police a lot, I've got a lot of time for 
            them. ",1969-12-17 02:56:41
23,John Cleese," Mr. er, Mr. Vercotti, what is your chief task 
            as Ron's manager? ",1969-12-17 03:09:14
24,Michael Palin," Well my main task is, er, to fix a sponsor 
            for the big jump. ",1969-12-17 03:22:11
25,John Cleese, And who is the sponsor? ,1969-12-17 03:27:19
26,Michael Palin," The Chippenham Brick Company. Ah, they, er, 
            pay all the bills, er, in return for which Ron will be carrying half 
            a hundredweight of their bricks. ",1969-12-17 03:53:24
27,John Cleese," I see. Well, er, it looks as if Ron is ready 
            now. He's got the bricks. He's had his passport checked and he's all 
            set to go. And he's off on the first ever cross-Channel jump. ",1969-12-17 04:28:45
28,Michael Palin," No. No. I'm taking him off the jumps, Er, 
            because I've got something lined up for Ron next week that I think 
            is very much more up his street. ",1969-12-17 06:51:40
29,John Cleese," Er, what's that? ",1969-12-17 07:02:33
30,Michael Palin," Er, Ron is going to eat Chichester 
            Cathedral. ",1969-12-17 09:09:50
31,John Cleese," Well, there he goes, Ron Obvious of Neaps 
            End, in an attempt which could make him the first man ever to eat an 
            entire Anglican Cathedral. ",1969-12-17 10:42:42
32,Michael Palin," Well, er, I think, David, this is something 
            which Ron and myself are really keen on. Ron is going to tunnel from 
            Godaiming here to Java here. ",1969-12-17 11:17:48
33,John Cleese, Java. ,1969-12-17 12:23:29
34,Michael Palin," Yeah, er, I, I personally think this is 
            going to make Ron a household name overnight. ",1969-12-17 12:54:30
35,John Cleese, And how far has he got? ,1969-12-17 13:17:28
36,Michael Palin," Er, well, he's quite far now, Dave, well on 
            the way. Well on the way, yeah. ",1969-12-17 13:31:04
37,John Cleese, Well where is he exactly? ,1969-12-17 13:35:27
38,Michael Palin, Yeah. ,1969-12-17 15:18:40
39,John Cleese, Where? ,1969-12-17 15:50:02
40,Michael Palin," Oh, er, well, er, you know, it's difficult 
            to say exactly. He's er, you know, in the area of er, Ron, how far 
            have you got? ",1969-12-17 17:04:47
41,Terry Jones, ,1969-12-17 18:22:34
42,Michael Palin," Yeah well keep digging lad, keep digging.
            ",1969-12-17 21:04:22
43,Terry Jones, Mr. Vercotti are you sure there isn't a spade? ,1969-12-17 21:20:18
44,John Cleese," Er, Mr. Vercotti, what do you say to people 
            who accuse you of exploiting Ron for your own purposes? ",1969-12-17 22:23:54
45,Michael Palin," Well, it's totally untrue, David. Ever since 
            I left Sicily I've been trying to do the best for Ron. I know what 
            Ron wants to do, I believe in him and I'm just trying to create the 
            opportunities for Ron to do the kind of things he wants to do. ",1969-12-17 22:24:45
46,John Cleese, And what's he going to do today? ,1969-12-17 23:40:10
47,Michael Palin," He's going to split a railway carriage with 
            his nose. ",1969-12-17 23:50:35
48,Michael Palin," The only difficult bit for Ron is getting 
            out of the Earth's atmosphere. Er, once he's in orbit he'll be able 
            to run straight to Mercury. ",1969-12-18 00:08:53
49,Michael Palin," I am now extremely hopeful that Ron will 
            break the world record for remaining underground. He's a wonderful 
            boy this, he's got this really enormous talent, this really huge 
            talent.",1969-12-18 01:14:13

6,John Cleese, Well what do you mean? I want a cat.,1969-12-18 07:06:38
7,Michael Palin," Listen, tell you what. I'll file its legs down 
            a bit, take its snout out, stick a few wires through its cheeks. 
            There you are, a lovely pussy cat.",1969-12-18 09:22:48
8,John Cleese, Its not a proper cat.,1969-12-18 09:39:40

            out of parrots. I'll tell you what though ... I'll lop its back legs 
            off, make good, strip the fur, stick a couple of wings on and staple 
            on a beak of your own choice. ",1969-12-18 12:08:33

            conversion ... Tell you what though, for free, terriers make lovely 
            fish. I mean I could do that for you straight away. Legs off, fins 
            on, stick a little pipe through the back of its neck so it can

4,Eric Idle, Right sir. ,1969-12-19 00:22:46
5,Graham Chapman," Now could you tell us roughly why you want to 
            become a librarian? ",1969-12-19 00:35:16
6,Eric Idle," Er, well, I've had a certain amount of experience 
            running a library at school. ",1969-12-19 00:51:33
7,Graham Chapman," Yes, yes. What sort of experience? ",1969-12-19 03:48:18
8,Eric Idle," Er, well for a time I ran the Upper Science 
            Library. ",1969-12-19 04:14:07
9,Graham Chapman," Yes, yes. Now Mr. Phipps, you do realize that 
            the post of librarian carries with it certain very important 
            responsibilities. I mean, there's the selection of books, the record 
            library, and the art gallery. Now it seems to me that your greatest 
            disadvantage is your lack of professional experience ... coupled 
            with the fact that, urn, being a gorilla, you would tend to frighten 
            people. ",1969-12-19 04:42:46

11,Graham Chapman, Yes he is. ,1969-12-19 06:17:24

            gorilla? ",1969-12-19 06:42:32
13,Graham Chapman," Well, you see applicants are not required to 
            fill in their species. ",1969-12-19 08:27:18
14,Terry Jones, What was that picture? ,1969-12-19 08:27:53
15,Graham Chapman," Sh! ... Mr. Phipps, what is your attitude toward 
            censorship in a public library? ",1969-12-19 09:05:02
16,Eric Idle," How do you mean, sir? ",1969-12-19 09:25:38
17,Terry Jones," Well I mean for instance, would you for instance 
            stock 'Last Exit to Brooklyn'... or ... 'Groupie'? ",1969-12-19 10:05:05

19,Terry Jones, Good. ,1969-12-19 14:22:16
20,Graham Chapman," Yes, well, that seems to me to be very sensible 
            Mr. Phipps. I can't pretend that this library hasn't had its 
            difficulties ... Mr. Robertson, your predecessor, an excellent 
            librarian, savaged three people last week and had to be destroyed.
            ",1969-12-19 14:25:22
21,Eric Idle, I'm sorry sir. ,1969-12-19 14:59:32
22,Graham Chapman," Oh, no, don't be sorry. You see, I don't believe 
            that libraries should be drab places where people sit in silence, 
            and that's been the main reason for our policy of employing wild 
            animals as librarians. ",1969-12-19 16:07:43
23,Terry Jones," And also, they're much more permissive. Pumas keep 
            Hank Janson on open shelves... ",1969-12-19 16:35:46

            job. ",1969-12-20 05:55:20
32,Graham Chapman," Get out, Mr. Librarian Phipps, seeing as you're 
            not a gorilla, but only dressed up as one, trying to deceive us in

            Last night in the Stadium of Light, Jarrow, we witnessed the

            came of age, in a European sense, with an almost Proustian display 
            of modern existentialist football. Vimally annihilating by midfield 
            moral argument the now surely obsolescent catennachio defensive 
            philosophy of Signor Alberto Fanffino. Bologna indeed were a side 
            intellectually out argued by a Jarrow team thrusting and bursting 
            with aggressive Kantian positivism and outstanding in this fine 
            Jarrow team was my man of the match, the arch-thinker, free

            Minister for External Affairs fell nearly seven miles during a 
            Liberal Conference in Ottawa about six years ago, and then quite 
            recently the Kenyan Minister for Agric. and Fish fell nearly twelve

            it's terribly exciting. You see the minister is quite dearly lodged 
            between rocks we know terribly little of. Terribly little. Of course 
            the main thing is we're getting color pictures of an extraordinarily 
            high quality. The important thing is, the really exciting thing is 
            the minister will ",1970-01-02 06:32:26

            vegetarian restaurant only, we serve no animal flesh of any kind. 
            We're not only proud of that, we're smug about it. So if you were to 
            come in here asking me to rip open a small defenseless chicken, so 
            you could chew its skin and eat its intestines, then I'm afraid I'd 
            have to ask you to leave. ",1970-01-02 13:06:39

            No more sherry for me don't you know. Warner House beat Badger House 
            for the Second Cuppa, remarkable. We had to put most of the second 
            form to sleep. No padre. Bad business. They were beginning to play
