0,Terry Jones," Michael Norman Randall, you have been found guilty 
            of the murder of Arthur Reginald Webster, Charles Patrick 
            Trumpington, Marcel Agnes Bernstein, Lewis Anona Rudd, John Malcolm 
            Kerr, Nigel Sinclair Robinson, Norman Arthur Potter, Felicity Jayne 
            Stone, Jean-Paul Reynard, Rachel Shirley Donaldson, Stephen Jay 
            Greenblatt, Karl-Heinz Mullet, Belinda Anne Ventham, Juan-Carlos 
            Fernandez, Thor Olaf Stensgaard, Lord Kimberrley of Pretoria, Lady 
            Kimberley of Pretoria, The Right Honourable Nigel WarmsIcy 
            Kimberley, Robert Henry Noonan and Felix James Bennett, on or about 
            the morning of the 19th December 1972. Have you anything to say 
            before I pass sentence? "
1,Eric Idle," Yes, sir. I'm very sorry. "
2,Terry Jones, Very sorry! 
3,Eric Idle," Yes, sir. It was a very very bad thing to have 
            done and I'm really very ashamed of myself, I can only say it won't 
            happen again. To have murdered so many people in such a short space 
            of time is really awful, and I really am very, very, very sorry that 
            I did it, and also that I've taken up so much of the court's 
            valuable time listening to the sordid details of these senseless 
            killings of mine. I would particularly like to say, a very personal 
            and sincere 'sorry' to you, m'lud, my lud for my appalling behavior 
            throughout this trial. I'd also like to say sorry to the police, for 
            putting them to so much trouble "
4,Graham Chapman," No, no, we were only doing our job. "
5,Eric Idle," It's very good of you to say that, but I know 
            what you've been through. "
6,Graham Chapman," No, no, we've had worse. "
7,Eric Idle," I know and I'm grateful I'd like to apologize too 
            to the prosecuting counsel for dragging him in here morning after 
            morning in such lovely weather. "
8,John Cleese," Well, I would have had to come in anyway. "
9,Eric Idle," Ah good, but what a presentation of a case! "
10,John Cleese, Oh thank you. 
11,Eric Idle," No, no, it's a privilege to watch you in action. 
            I never had a chance. "
12,John Cleese, Oh yes you did. 
13,Eric Idle, Not after that summing up. Great. 
14,John Cleese, Oh thank you. 
15,Eric Idle," And now I must come to the jury. What can I say. 
            I've dragged you in here, day after day, keeping you away from your 
            homes, your jobs, your loved ones, just to hear the private details 
            of my petty atrocities. "
16,Michael Palin," No, no, 'it was very interesting. "
17,Eric Idle, But you could have had a much nicer case. 
18,Michael Palin," No, no, murder's much more fun. "
19,Eric Idle, 
20,Terry Jones, Well er... not necessarily. 
21,Eric Idle," No, m'lud, the full penalty of the law is hardly 
            sufficient, I insist I must be made an example of. "
22,Terry Jones, Well yes and no. I mean society at large... 
23,Eric Idle," Oh no, m'lud. Not with mass murder. "
24,Terry Jones," But in this case, "
25,Eric Idle," Oh, come on, m'lud, you've got to give me life.
            "
26,Eric Idle, 
27,Terry Jones, Ten years! 
28,Eric Idle, Well five then. Be fair. 
29,Terry Jones," No, no. I'm giving you three months. "
30,Eric Idle," Oh no, that's so embarrassing. I won't hear of 
            it. Give me six...please. "
31,Terry Jones," Well, all right. Six months. "
32,Eric Idle," Thank you, m'lud. "
33,Terry Jones, But suspended. 
34,Eric Idle, Oh no. 
35,Michael Palin, Three cheers for the defendant. Hip. Hip. 
36,Michael Palin, Hip. Hip. 
37,Michael Palin, Hip. Hip. 
38,Eric Idle," For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good 
            fellow For he's a jolly good fellow "
0,Michael Palin," This little-known Icelandic saga, written 
            by an unknown hand in the late thirteenth century, has remained 
            undiscovered until today. Now it comes to your screens for the first 
            time. Fresh from the leaves of Iceland's history. The terrible 
            'Njorl's Saga'. "
1,Michael Palin, It's not that terrible. 
2,John Cleese," No, I meant terribly violent. "
3,Michael Palin," Oh yeah, yeah. "
4,Michael Palin," Erik Njorl's, son of Frothgar, leaves his 
            home to seek Hangar the EIder at the home of Thorvald Nlodvisson, 
            the son of Gudleif, half brother of Thorgier, the priest of Ljosa 
            water, who took to wife Thurunn, the mother of Thorkel Braggart, the 
            slayer of Cudround the powerful, who knew Howal, son of Geernon, son 
            of Erik from Valdalesc, son of Arval Gristlebeard, son of Harken, 
            who killed Bjortguaard in Sochnadale in Norway over Cudreed, 
            daughter of Thorkel Long, the son of Kettle-Trout, the half son of 
            Harviyoun Half-troll, father of Ingbare the Brave, who with Isenbert 
            of Gottenberg the daughter of Hangbard the Fierce ... "
5,Michael Palin," I must apologize for an error in the saga. 
            Evidently Thorgier, the Prieit of Ljosa water who took to wife 
            Thurunn, the mother of Thorkel Braggart, the slayer of Gudmund the 
            powerful, who knew Howal, son of Geernon, son of Erik from Vadalesc 
            ... "
6,Michael Palin," Well I'm afraid we're having a little 
            trouble getting this very exciting Icelandic saga started. If any of 
            you at home have any ideas about how to get this exciting saga 
            started again here's the address to write to: "
7,Michael Palin," Help the Exciting Icelandic Saga, 18b 
            MacNorten Buildings, Oban. "
8,John Cleese, 
9,Michael Palin, Well it wasn't all that terrible. 
10,John Cleese," No, no, I meant terrible in the sense of 
            unfortunate. "
11,Michael Palin, Oh. 
12,John Cleese," Anyway, our plea for assistance has been 
            answered by the North Malden Icelandic Saga Society who've given us 
            some very useful information about the saga and so we carD' on now 
            with 'Njorl's Saga' with our thanks going, once again, to the North 
            Maiden Icelandic Saga Society. "
13,Michael Palin," Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar rode off into 
            the desolate plain. "
14,Michael Palin, Welcome to North Malden. 
15,Michael Palin," And we apologize to viewers of 'Njorl's 
            Saga' who may be confused by some of the references to North Malden. 
            After a frank exchange of views we have agreed to carry on showing 
            this version supplied to us by the North Malden Icelandic Saga 
            Society on the undertaking that future scenes will adhere more 
            closely to the spirit of twelfth-century Iceland. "
16,Michael Palin," With moist eyes, Erik leaves this happy 
            land to return to the harsh uneconomic realities of life in the land 
            of Ljosa waters. On his way Erik rested a while in the land of 
            Bjornsstrand - the land of dark forces, where Gildor was King. "
17,John Cleese," Hello? Is that the North Malden 
            Icelandic Society? "
18,Michael Palin," Yes, that's right. "
19,John Cleese, About this saga. 
20,Michael Palin," Oh yes, the Icelandic saga. "
21,John Cleese, Yes. 
22,Michael Palin," Good, isn't it. "
23,John Cleese," Well er, I don't know, but you promised us that 
            you would stick to the spirit of the original text. "
24,Michael Palin," Yes, that's right. "
25,John Cleese," Well I mean a lot of these things that are 
            happening, well they just don't quite ring true. "
26,Michael Palin," Well, it's a new interpretation really. "
27,John Cleese, Well we don't want a new... 
28,John Cleese," ... I mean we wanted the proper thing... I mean 
            just look what's happening now. "
29,Michael Palin," Banners were a very important part of Icelandic 
            lore, Mr. Mills. "
30,John Cleese," No, no, I'm sorry I, I can't accept that, it's 
            gone too far, I'm very sorry but we'll have to terminate the 
            agreement. You're just trying to cash in on the BBC's exciting 
            Icelandic saga. "
31,Michael Palin," That's business, Mr. Mills. "
32,John Cleese," Well, that's as maybe but it's not the way the 
            BBC works. "
33,Michael Palin," Well I'm sorry you feel that way but er, you know, 
            if you ever want to come to Malden... "
0,Graham Chapman," 8 o'clock is a peak viewing hour so naturally we tend 
            to sack to our comedy output - unless of course there's sport - 
            because of course we know this is popular, and popularity is what 
            television is about. Quite frankly I'm sick and tired of people 
            accusing us of being ratings conscious. "
1,Terry Jones, 
2,Terry Jones, Thank you. 
3,Graham Chapman," Now I'm really cheesed off. I mean it's not your 
            high-brow bleeding plays that pull in the viewers, you know. "
4,Terry Jones, 
5,Graham Chapman, 
6,Terry Jones, Thank you. 
7,Graham Chapman," He wants to sit down and he wants to be entertained, 
            he doesn't want a load... "
8,Terry Jones, 
9,John Cleese," Case dismissed, m'lud? "
10,Terry Jones," Oh all right, five years. "
11,John Cleese," Thank you, m'lud. "
12,Terry Jones, Call the next case please. 
13,John Cleese," Call Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar, 
            brother of Hangnor... (etc.). "
14,Eric Idle," You are Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar... "
15,Terry Jones, Get on with it! 
16,Eric Idle, Will you raise your right hand. 
17,Terry Jones," He obviously can't raise his right hand, you silly 
            usher person... can you raise your right leg Mr. Njorl? "
18,Eric Idle," Can you raise any part of your body, Mr. Njorl? "
19,Eric Idle," I see... well, we'll skip that... well, just take 
            the book in your right hand Mr. Njorl without raising any part of 
            your body... Oh .... "
20,Terry Jones," What is it now, you persistently silly usher? "
21,Eric Idle,", He can't hold the Bible m'lud. "
22,Terry Jones," Well screw the Bible! Let's get on with this 
            bleeding trial, I've got a Gay Lib meeting at 6 o'clock. 
            Superintendent Lufthansa will you please read the charge. "
23,Graham Chapman," Is a charge strictly necessary, m'lud? "
24,Terry Jones, 
25,Graham Chapman," Oh sorry! Right, here we go. You are 
            hereby charged. one, that you did, on or about 1126, conspire to 
            publicize a London Borough in the course of a BBC sags; two, that 
            you were willfully and persistently a foreigner; three, that you 
            conspired to do 2 things not normally considered illegal; four, that 
            you were caught , in possession of an offensive weapon, viz. the big 
            brown table down at the police station. "
26,Terry Jones, The big brown table down at the police station? 
27,Graham Chapman," It's the best we could find, m'lud ... and 
            five... all together now... "
28,John Cleese, Call Police Constable Pan-Am. 
29,Michael Palin," No, I shall deny that to the last breath in my 
            body. "
30,John Cleese," Police constable, do you recognize 
            the defendant? "
31,Michael Palin, No. Never seen him before in my life. 
32,John Cleese," Constable, will you please tell the 
            court in your . own words what happened? "
33,Michael Palin, Oh yes! 
34,Michael Palin," Defendant! Sorry. Sorry, super. I clearly saw 
            the defendant ... doing whatever he's accused of Red handed. When 
            kicked... he said: 'It's a fair ... cop, I done it all ... Right... 
            no doubt about... that'. Then, bound as he was to the chair, he 
            assaulted myself and three other constables while bouncing around 
            the area. The end. "
35,Michael Palin," Thank you, thank you... and for my next piece 
            of evidence... "
36,Graham Chapman," I think you'd better leave it there, 
            constable. "
37,John Cleese," Excellent evidence, constable "
38,Terry Jones," Is he in there, d'you think? . .. Hello... Hello! 
            Defendant, are you there ... coo-ee! De-fend-ant... "
39,Terry Jones, I'm sorry. 
0,John Cleese," And now the Stock Market Report by Exchange 
            Telegraph. "
1,Eric Idle," Trading was crisp at the start of the day with some 
            brisk business on the floor. Rubber hardened and string remained 
            confident. Little bits of tin consolidated although biscuits sank 
            after an early gain and stools remained anonymous. Armpits rallied 
            well after a poor start. Nipples rose dramatically during the 
            morning but had declined by mid-afternoon, while teeth clenched and 
            buttocks remained firm. Small' dark furry things increased severely 
            on the floor, whilst rude jellies wobbled up and down, and bounced 
            against rising thighs which had spread to all parts of the country 
            by mid-afternoon. After lunch naughty things dipped sharply forcing 
            giblets upwards with the nicky nacky noo. Ting tang tong rankled 
            dithely, little tipples pooped and poppy things went pong! Gibble 
            gabble gobble went the rickety rackety roo and ... "
0,Graham Chapman," Hullo, Mrs. Premise."
1,John Cleese," Hullo, Mrs. Conclusion."
2,Graham Chapman, Busy Day?
3,John Cleese, Busy? I just spent four hours burying the cat.
4,Graham Chapman, *Four hours* to bury a cat?
5,John Cleese, Yes - it wouldn't keep still.
6,Graham Chapman," Oh - it wasn't dead, then?"
7,John Cleese," No, no - but it's not at all well, so as we were 
            going to be on the safe side."
8,Graham Chapman," Quite right - you don't want to come back from 
            Sorrento to a dead cat. It'd be so anticlimactic. Yes, kill it now, 
            that's what I say. We're going to have to have our budgie put down."
9,John Cleese, Really - is it very old?
10,Graham Chapman," No, we just don't like it. We're going to take 
            it to the vet tomorrow."
11,John Cleese," Tell me, how do they put budgies down, then?"
12,Graham Chapman," Well, it's funny you should ask that, because 
            I've just been reading a great big book about how to put your budgie 
            down, and apparently you can either hit them with the book, or you 
            can shoot them just there, just above the beak."
13,John Cleese," Just there? Well, well, well. 'Course, Mrs. 
            Essence flushed hers down the loo."
14,Graham Chapman," No, you shouldn't do that - no, that's 
            dangerous. They *breed* in the *sewers*!"
0,Graham Chapman," Hello, Mrs. Premise. "
1,John Cleese," Hello, Mrs. Conclusion. "
2,Graham Chapman, Busy day? 
3,John Cleese," Busy! I've just spent four hours burying the 
            cat. "
4,Graham Chapman, Four hours to bury a cat? 
5,John Cleese," Yes! It wouldn't keep still, wriggling about 
            howling its head off. "
6,Graham Chapman, Oh - it wasn't dead then? 
7,John Cleese," Well, no, no, but it's not at all a well cat 
            so as we were going away for a fortnight's holiday, I thought I'd 
            better bury it just to be on the safe side. "
8,Graham Chapman," Quite fight. You don't want to come hack 
            from Sortonto to a dead cat. It'd be so anticlimactic. Yes, kill it 
            now, that's what I say. "
9,John Cleese, Yes. 
10,Graham Chapman," We're going to have our budgie put down.
            "
11,John Cleese, Really? Is it very old? 
12,Graham Chapman," No. We just don't like it. We're going to 
            take it to the vet tomorrow. "
13,John Cleese," Tell me, how do they put budgies down then?
            "
14,Graham Chapman," Well it's funny you should ask that, but 
            I've just been reading a great big book about how to put your budgie 
            down, and apparently you can either hit them with the book, or, you 
            can shoot them just there, just above the beak. "
15,John Cleese, Just there! 
16,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
17,John Cleese," Well well well. 'Course, Mrs. Essence 
            flushed hers down the 1oo. "
18,Graham Chapman," Ooh! No! You shouldn't do that - no 
            that's dangerous. Yes, they breed in the sewers, and eventually you 
            get evil-smelling flocks of huge soiled budgies flying out of 
            people's lavatories infringing their personal freedom. "
19,John Cleese," It's a funny thing freedom. I mean how can 
            any of us be really free when we still have personal possessions.
            "
20,Graham Chapman," You can't. You can't ' I mean, how can I 
            go off and join Frelimo when I've got nine more installments to pay 
            on the fridge. "
21,John Cleese," No, you can't. You can't. Well this is the 
            whole crux of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'Roads to Freedom'. "
22,Graham Chapman," No, it bloody isn't. The nub of that is, 
            his characters stand for all of us in their desire to avoid action. 
            Mind you, the man at the off-license says it's an everyday story of 
            French country folk. "
23,John Cleese, What does he know? 
24,Graham Chapman, Nothing. 
25,John Cleese," Sixty new pence for a bottle of Maltese 
            Claret. Well I personally think Jean-Paul's masterwork is an 
            allegory of man's search for commitment. "
26,Graham Chapman, No it isn't. 
27,John Cleese, Yes it is. 
28,Graham Chapman, Isn't. 
29,John Cleese, 'Tis. 
30,Graham Chapman, No it isn't. 
31,John Cleese," All right. We can soon settle this. We'll 
            ask him. "
32,Graham Chapman, Do you know him? 
33,John Cleese," Yes, we met on holiday last year. "
34,Graham Chapman, In Ibeezer? 
35,John Cleese," Yes. He was staying there with his wife and 
            Mr. and Mr. Genet. Oh, I did get on well with Madam S. We were like 
            that. "
36,Graham Chapman, What was Jean-Paul like? 
37,John Cleese," Well, you know, a bit moody. Yes, he didn't 
            join in the fun much. Just sat there thinking. Still, Mr. Rotter 
            caught him a few times with the whoopee cushion. "
38,Graham Chapman," Well, we'll give a tinkle then. "
39,John Cleese," Yes, all right. She said they were in the 
            book. "
40,Eric Idle, It's on the drier. 
41,John Cleese," No, no, that's Budapest. Oh here we are 
            Sartre ... Sartre. "
42,John Cleese," Oh, thank you, Mrs. Varley. "
43,Graham Chapman," Oh well, I'll ring BEA then. "
44,John Cleese," Oh look, Paris! "
45,Graham Chapman," That's not Paris. Jean-Paul wouldn't live 
            here. It's a right old dump. "
46,Eric Idle," But this is where they were wrong. For this was 
            no old dump, but a town with a future, an urban Eldorado where the 
            businessmen of today can enjoy the facilities of tomorrow in the 
            comfort of yesterday. Provided by a go-getting, go-ahead council who 
            know just how loud money can talk. "
47,John Cleese," Well ifs none of my business but we had the 
            same trouble with one of our Icelandic sagas. These people are 
            terribly keen but they do rather tend to take over. I think I'd 
            stick to Caribbean Islands if I were you. "
48,John Cleese," Here - this is not Paris, this is Iceland.
            "
49,Graham Chapman," Oh, well, Paris must be over there then.
            "
50,John Cleese," Oh, here we are, Number 25 .... "
51,Graham Chapman, Who's he? 
52,John Cleese," Never heard of him. Flat 6, Marcel Marceau, 
            Walking Against the Wind Ltd.. Flat 7, Indira Gandhi? "
53,Graham Chapman," She gets about a bit, doesn't she? "
54,John Cleese," Yes, Flat 8, Jean-Paul and Betty-Muriel 
            Same. "
55,John Cleese," C'est nous, Betty-Muriel, excusez que nous 
            sorerues en retard. "
56,John Cleese," Oui, merci. "
57,Michael Palin," (MICHAEL) Oh, rubbish. "
58,Graham Chapman, 
59,Michael Palin, Oh yes. Good day. 
60,John Cleese," Hello! Oh this is Mrs. Conclusion from No. 
            46. "
61,Michael Palin," Nice to meet you, dear. "
62,Graham Chapman, Hello. 
63,John Cleese," How's the old man, then? "
64,Michael Palin," Oh, don't ask. He's in one of his bleeding

            Oooh! You're not a Marxist are you Mrs. Conclusion? "
65,Graham Chapman," No, I'm a Revisionist. "
66,Michael Palin," Oh good. I mean, look at this place! I'm at 
            my wits' end. Revolutionary leaflets everywhere. One of these days 
            I'll revolutionary leaflets him. If it wasn't for the goat you 
            couldn't get in here for propaganda. "

            with him? "
68,Michael Palin, Yes come along. 
69,John Cleese, Thank you. 
70,Michael Palin," But be careful. He's had a few. Mind you he's 
            as good as gold in the morning, I've got to hand it to him, but come 
            lunchtime it's a bottle of vin ordinalre - six glasses and he's 
            ready to agitate. "
71,John Cleese," Coo-ee! Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul! It's only us. 
            Oh pardon ... c'est m'me nous... "
72,John Cleese," Jean-Paul. Your famous trilogy 'Rues i

2,Michael Palin," They live in a sunshine paradise, a 
            Caribbean dream, where only reality is missing. "
3,Graham Chapman, For this is Whicker Island. 
4,John Cleese," An island inhabited entirely by 
            ex-international interviewers in pursuit of the impossible dream.
            "
5,Eric Idle," The whole problem of Whicker Island is here 
            in a nutshell. "
6,Terry Jones, There are just too many Whickers.

            colonial Campari-land where the clink of glasses mingles with the 
            murmur of a million mosquitoes, where waterfalls of whisky wash away 
            the worries of a world-weary Whicker, where gin and tonic jingle in 
            a gyroscopic jubilee of something beginning With J - Father Pierre, 
            why did you stay on here? "

0,Eric Idle," Who, a year ago, had heard of Mr. and Mrs. 
            Brian Norris of 37, Gledhill Gardens, Parsons Green? And yet their 
            epic journey in EBW 343 has set them alongside Thor Heyerdahl and 
            Sir Edmund Hillary. Starting only with a theory, Mr. Norris set out 
            to prove that the inhabitants of Hounslow could have been 
            descendants of the people of Surbiton who had made the great trek 
            north. No newcomer to this field, Mr. Norris's 'A Short History of 
            Motor Traffic Between Parley and Esher' had become a best-selling 
            minor classic in the car-swapping belt. "
1,Terry Jones, Are you still running the GDBDMDB?
2,Eric Idle," Yes, but I've had the excess nipples woppled 
            to remove tamping. "
3,Eric Idle, Jolly good. 
4,Eric Idle," Were these just coincidences, or were they, as 
            Mr. Norris believed, part of an identical cultural background? One 
            further discovery convinced him. "
5,Michael Palin, I'm convinced. 
6,Eric Idle, But how to prove it. 
7,Michael Palin, But how to prove it. 
8,Eric Idle," There was only one way to see if the journey 
            between Surbiton and Hounslow was possible, and that was to try and 
            make it. Months of preparation followed whilst Mr. Norris continued 
            his research in the Putney Public Library, "
9,Eric Idle," Finally, by April, they were ready. On the 
            23rd, Mr. and Mrs. Norris set out from 'Abide-A-Wee' to motor the 
            fifteen miles to Surbiton, watched by a crowd of local well-wishers.

            (successfully). 9.00 Set out on historic journey. "
11,Eric Idle," On the morning of the 24th, early to avoid the 
            traffic, Mr. Norris's historic expedition set out from Surbiton - 
            destination Hounslow. Early on they began to perceive encouraging 
            signs. "
0,John Cleese, Hello. 
1,Graham Chapman, Hello. 
2,John Cleese," Well, last week we showed you how to become a 
            gynecologist. And this week on 'How to do it' we're going to show 
            you how to play the flute, how to split an atom, how to construct a 
            box girder bridge, how to irrigate the Sahara Desert and make vast 
            new areas of land cultivatable, but first, here's Jackie to tell you 
            all how to rid the world of all known diseases. "
3,Eric Idle," Hello, Alan. "
4,John Cleese," Hello, Jackie. "
5,Eric Idle," Well, first of all become a doctor and discover a 
            marvellous cure for something, and then, when the medical profession 
            really starts to take notice of you, you can jolly well tell them 
            what to do and make sure they get everything right so there'll never 
            be any diseases ever again. "
6,John Cleese," Thanks, Jackie. Great idea. How to play the flute.
            "
7,Graham Chapman," Great, great, Alan. Well, next week we'Ll be showing 
            you how black and white people can live together in peace and 
            harmony, and Alan will be over in Moscow showing us how to reconcile 
            the Russians and the Chinese. So, until next week, cheerio. "

            Development. "

13,John Cleese," Good thing, too. "
14,Terry Jones, She was my best friend. 
15,John Cleese," Oh, mother, don't be so Sentimental. Things explode 
            every day. "
16,Terry Jones," Yes, I suppose so. Anyway, I didn't really 
            like her that much. "
0,Eric Idle," Hello, I'm your new vicar. Can I interest you in 
            any encyclopedias? "
1,Terry Jones," Ah, no thank you. We're not Church people, 
            thank you. "
2,Eric Idle," How about brushes? Nylon or bristle? Strong-tufted, 
            attractive colors. "
3,Terry Jones," No - really, thank you, vicar. "
4,Eric Idle, Oh dear ... Turkey? Cup final tickets? 
5,Terry Jones," No, no really, we're just not religious thank 
            you. "
6,Eric Idle," Oh, well. Bye bye. "
7,Terry Jones," Bye bye, vicar. "
8,Eric Idle," Remember, if you do want anything... jewelry, Ascot 
            water heaters... "
9,Terry Jones," Thank you, vicar. "
10,Graham Chapman," This is where Mrs. Shazam was so wrong. Exploding 
            is a perfectly normal medical phenomenon. In many fields of medicine 
            nowadays, a dose of dynamite can do a world of good. For instance, 
            athlete's foot - an irritating condition - can be cured by applying 
            a small charge of TNT between each toe. "
11,Eric Idle," Hello, I'm your new vicar, can I interest you in 
            any of these watches, pens or biros? "
12,Graham Chapman," No ... I'm not religious, I'm afraid. "
13,Eric Idle," Oh, souvenirs, badges... a little noddy dog for the 
            back of the car? "
14,Graham Chapman," No thank you, vicar. Good morning. "
15,Eric Idle," Oh, morning. "
16,Graham Chapman," Now, many of the medical profession are skeptical 
            about my work. They point to my record of treatment of athlete's 
            foot sufferers - eighty-four dead, sixty-five severely wounded and 
            twelve missing believed cured. But then, people laughed at Bob Hope, 
            people laughed at my wife when she wrapped herself up in greaseproof 
            paper and hopped into the Social Security office, but that doesn't 
            mean that Pasteur was wrong! Look, I'll show you what I mean. "
0,Eric Idle," John Cobbley is the Musical and Artistic 
            Director of Covent Garden. He is himself a talented musician, he is 
            a world famous authority on nineteenth-century Russian music and 
            he's come into the studio tonight to talk about Tchaikovsky, which 
            is a bit of a pity as this is 'Farming Club'. On 'Farming Club' 
            tonight we'll be taking a look at the Ministry's "
1,Eric Idle," Tchaikovsky. Was he the tortured soul who 
            poured out his immortal longings into dignified passages of stately 
            music, or was he just an old poof who wrote tunes? "
2,John Cleese," Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born in 
            1840 in a Ken Russell film just outside St Petersburg. His father 
            (Leo McKern), a free-lance bishop, was married to Vern Plachenka 
            (Julie Christie) but secretly deeply in love with Margo Farenka 
            (Shirley Abicair) and the strangely flatulent Madame Ranevsky 
            (Norris McWhirter). Soon, however, the family (Eldridge Cleaver, 
            Moira Lister and Stan the Bat) moved to the neighboring industrial 
            village of Omsk (Eddie Waring) where they soon found themselves, 
            sadly, quite unable to cope (Anthony Barber). In i863, however, 
            Tchaikovsky was sent to Moscow to study the piano and, when he'd 
            finished that, the living room. Maurice takes up the story. "
3,Michael Palin," Well, guess what, the very next thing he did was 
            to go to this extraordinary but extraordinary duckety-poos 
            semi-Mondrian house in Robin Russia. Here Tommy Tchaikovsky wrote 
            some of the most Sammy super symphonies you've ever Henry heard in 
            the whole of your Lily life. "
4,Michael Palin," She was such a good composer that everybody, but 
            everybody, wanted to know, and quite right too, because she wrote 
            some lovely bits, such as Sally Sleeping Beauty, Poesy Pathetique, 
            Adrian 1812 and lots of Conny concerti for Vera violin and Peter 
            Piano Fanny Forte. "
5,John Cleese," But what do we really know of this 
            tortured ponce? "
6,Graham Chapman," Well, if you can imagine the size of 
            Nelson's Column, which is roughly three times the size of a London 
            bus, then Tchaikovsky was much smaller. His head was about the same 
            size as that of an extremely large dog, that is to say, two very 
            small dogs, or four very large hamsters, or one medium-size rabbit 
            if you count the whole of the body and not just the head. Robin. "
7,Terry Jones," Thank you. Well here is a three-stage model 
            of Tchaikovsky... here you see the legs, used for walking around, 
            and which can be jettisoned at night ... "
8,Graham Chapman, Peter. 
9,Eric Idle, Simon. 
10,John Cleese, Maurice. 
11,Michael Palin," Me. Well, poor pet, she was like a lost lamb in 
            an abattoir. Eventually she Dickie died of Colin Cholera in St Patsy 
            Petersburg, in Gettie great Percy pain. "
12,Eric Idle," Here to play Tchaikovsky's first piano 
            concerto in B Flat Minor is the world-famous soloist Sviatoslav 
            Richter. 'During the performance he will escape from a sack, three 
            padlocks and a pair of handcuffs. "

6,Terry Gilliam, And spacemen! 
7,Terry Jones," Here is a revised list. Women, children, Red 
            Indians and spacemen, "
8,Eric Idle," Well it's a sort of impression of what a 
            kind of Renaissance courtier artist might have looked like at the 
            court of one of the great families like the Medici or the Borgias...
            "
9,Graham Chapman," No it's not, it's more Hemish than 
            Italian. "
10,Michael Palin," Yes - that's a Flemish merchant of the 
            fifteenth or sixteenth centuries... "
11,Eric Idle, What! With these tassels... 
12,Graham Chapman," Yes, yes. They had those fined doublets 
            going tapering down into the full hose you know - exactly like that.
            "
13,Terry Jones, 
14,Eric Idle," No, it is not a Flemish merchant. It's more 
            a sort of idealized version of the complete Renaissance Man... "
15,Terry Jones," Oh, all right. "
16,Graham Chapman, It's not... 
17,Terry Jones, All right! All right! 
18,Eric Idle," Flemish merchants did not wear 
            hand- embroidered chevrons. They did not! "
19,John Cleese," Yes, Gomez? "
20,Terry Gilliam," Twenty-right guineas, sir! Ooh, sorry. "
21,John Cleese," You fool Gomez - that's twenty-eight guineas

23,John Cleese, Are you supposed to speak? 
24,Eric Idle," No, sir. "
25,John Cleese, But you've just spoken! 
26,Eric Idle," Oh, sorry, sir. "
27,John Cleese," You fool, that's, that's fifty-six guineas

            nice crisp clean checks, pert pieces of copper coinage thrust deep 
            into trouser pockets, romantic foreign money rolling against the 
            thigh with rough familiarity, beautiful wayward curlicued banknotes,

23,Graham Chapman, Why?! 
24,Terry Jones, You rook odd rike that. 
25,Graham Chapman," I do not look odd like this - it's that lot that 
            looks odd. It's bleeding weird having half the Tudor nobility 
            ligging around on motorized bicycles. "
26,Terry Jones, It's vely sullearist. 
27,Graham Chapman, Horsefeathers! 
28,Eric Idle," Listen mate. I'm beginning,to have my doubts 
            about you. "
29,Terry Jones, What do you mean? 
30,Eric Idle," I'm telling you straight, mate. I don't think 
            you're Luchino Visconti at all. "
31,Terry Jones," Of course I am. Me vely impoltant Itarian firm 
            dilectol. "

37,John Cleese, The same. Only more violent. 
38,Graham Chapman, What? 
39,John Cleese," I haven't got time to go chasing after him, 
            there's violence to be done. "
0,Eric Idle, Gerald? 
1,Eric Idle, Norman? 
2,Eric Idle," Well I'd do the Reichstag bathroom in 
            purples and golds and ban abortion on demand. "
3,Terry Jones, 
4,Eric Idle, Halibut. 
5,Terry Jones, The jugged fish is halibut. 
6,Eric Idle," What fish have you got that isn't jugged, then? "
7,Terry Jones, Rabbit. 
8,Eric Idle, What? Rabbit fish? 
9,Terry Jones, Yes. It's got fins. 
10,Eric Idle, Is it dead? 
11,Terry Jones," Well, it was coughing up blood last night. "
12,Eric Idle," All right I'll have the dead unjugged rabbit fish.
            "
13,Eric Idle, Well that was really horrible. 
14,Terry Jones, You're always complaining. 
15,Eric Idle, What's for afters? 
16,Terry Jones," Well there's rat cake ... rat sorbet... rat 
            pudding... or strawberry tart. "
17,Eric Idle, Strawberry tart?! 
18,Terry Jones, Well it's got some rat in it. 
19,Eric Idle, How much? 
20,Terry Jones," Three, rather a lot really. "
21,Eric Idle," ... well, I'll have a slice without so much rat in 
            it. "
22,Eric Idle, Appalling. 
23,Terry Jones," Moan, moan, moan. "
24,Graham Chapman," Hello, mum, hello, dad. "
25,Eric Idle," Hello, son. "
26,Graham Chapman, There's a dead bishop on the landing. 
27,Terry Jones, Where did that come from? 
28,Graham Chapman, What do you mean? 
29,Terry Jones, What's its diocese? 
30,Graham Chapman, Well it looked a bit Bath and Wellsish to me. 
31,Eric Idle, I'll go and have a look. 
32,Terry Jones, I don't know who keeps bringing them in here. 
33,Graham Chapman, Well it's not me. 
34,Terry Jones," I've put three out by the bin and the dustmen won't 
            touch 'em. "
35,Eric Idle, 
36,Terry Jones, How do you know? 
37,Eric Idle," Tattooed on the back of his neck. I'm going to call 
            the police. "
38,Terry Jones, Shouldn't you call the Church? 
39,Graham Chapman, Call the Church police. 
40,Eric Idle," ,.. all fight. "
41,Michael Palin, Yes! 
42,Terry Jones, There's another dead bishop on the landing. 
43,Michael Palin, Suffragan or diocesan? 
44,Terry Jones, How should I know? 
45,Michael Palin," It's tattooed on the back of their 
            necks. Ere! Is that rat tart? "
46,Terry Jones, Yes. 
47,Michael Palin, Disgusting. Right! The hunt is on. 
48,Eric Idle," All right, it's a fair cop, but society is to blame.
            "
49,Michael Palin, Agreed. 
50,Eric Idle," I would like the three by the bin to be taken into 
            consideration. "
51,Michael Palin," Right. And now, I'd like to conclude 
            this arrest with a hymn. "
0,John Cleese, What a simply super little place! 
1,Eric Idle," Yes, they've done wonders with it. You 
            know this used to be one of the most swampy disease infested areas 
            of the whole jungle, and they've turned it into this smashing little 
            restaurant. "
2,Michael Palin," Hello, Mr. Spare-Buttons-Supplied-With-The- 
            Shirt. Nice to see you again. "
3,Eric Idle," These are some of my fellow explorers: 
            Sir Charles Farquarson, Briar Bailey, Betty Bailey and this is Mr. 
            Akwekwe, who started the whole place. "
4,Graham Chapman, It really is super. 
5,Carol Cleveland, 
6,Michael Palin, May I recommend the alligator purees. 
7,Michael Palin," Now then, have you decided? "
8,Eric Idle," Ye-es ... Well there's two avocado 
            vinaigrette here and what are you going to have Briar? "
9,Carol Cleveland," Er quiche lorraine for me, please. "
10,Michael Palin," Right, so that's two avocado, one quiche ... "
11,Michael Palin," So, that's two avocado, one quiche ... "
12,Graham Chapman, And a soup of the day. 
13,Michael Palin," Right. (sinister sound of jungle drums in 
            distance; close up of look of fear in Akwekwe's eyes) And to follow?
            "
14,Eric Idle," Two chicken a la reine, with sauce 
            provencale. "
15,John Cleese, And one scampi desiree. 
16,Graham Chapman," And boeuf bourguignon with a green salad.
            "
17,Michael Palin," Right on. Two chicken! One scampi! One boeuf with 
            green salad! "
18,Michael Palin, There may be ... a little delay. 
19,Eric Idle," That's fine but we have to be out by 
            three. "
20,Michael Palin," Yes, sir. Yes, we'll try. "
0,Eric Idle," The BBC would like 'to announce that the next 
            scene is not considered suitable for family viewing. It contains 
            scenes of violence, involving people's heads and arms getting 
            chopped off, their ears nailed to trees, and their toenails pulled 
            out in slow motion. There are also scenes of naked women with floppy 
            breasts, and also at one point you can see a pair of buttocks and 
            there's another bit where I'll swear you can see everything, but my 
            friend says it's just the way he's holding the spear. "
1,Eric Idle, And now back to the story.
0,Graham Chapman, And now back to the story. 
1,Graham Chapman," That was a nasty business back at the 
            restaurant. "
2,John Cleese," Yes, I thought most places took 
            Barclaycard nowadays. "
3,Eric Idle," Where do you think they're taking us, 
            Brian? "
4,Carol Cleveland, God knows! 
5,Graham Chapman, 
6,Eric Idle, 
7,Graham Chapman," No, no, no, next to that. "
8,John Cleese, The London Brick Company? 
9,Graham Chapman," No, no, no, no - next to that. "
10,John Cleese," The forbidden plateau of Roiurama, the 
            Lost World, thrown up by mighty earth movements thousands of 
            millions of years ago, where strange primeval creatures defying 
            evolution, lurk in the dark, impenetrable forests, cut off forever 
            from the outside world. "
11,Eric Idle, I still can't see it. 
12,Carol Cleveland," You don't think that's where they're 
            taking us? "
13,Graham Chapman," Yes, and God knows what we'll find there.
            "
14,Michael Palin, What page please? 
15,Eric Idle, What? 
16,Michael Palin, 
17,Eric Idle, 
18,Michael Palin, 
0,Graham Chapman," Meanwhile back in London ... at the British 
            Explorers' Club in the Mall... "
1,Terry Jones," Any news of Betty Bailey's expedition, 
            Hargreaves? "
2,Michael Palin, Er ... um ... er... 
3,Terry Jones, 
4,Michael Palin, 
5,Terry Jones, That's my line. 
6,Michael Palin," Oh, sorry. 'Where were they going, sir'? "
7,Terry Jones, The Lost World of Roiurama. 
8,Michael Palin," Yes sir, we've got a telegram. "
9,Terry Jones, OH 
10,Michael Palin, 
11,Terry Jones, I wonder what's gone wrong. 
12,Michael Palin, For God's sake be careful... 
13,Terry Jones, 
14,Michael Palin," For God's sake be careful, sir. "
15,Eric Idle," My God, Betty, we're done for... "
16,Graham Chapman," We'll never get out of here... we're 
            completely lost, lost. Even the natives have gone. "
17,John Cleese," Goodbye Betty, Goodbye Farquarson. Goodbye 
            Brian. It's been a great expedition... "
18,John Cleese, Great expedition .. · 
19,Graham Chapman," All that'll be left of us will be a map, a 
            compass and a few feet of film, recording our last moments... "
20,John Cleese, Wait a moment! 
21,Carol Cleveland, What is it? 
22,John Cleese," If we're on film, there must be someone 
            filming us. "
23,Eric Idle," My God, Betty, you're right! "
24,Graham Chapman, Look! Great to see you! 
25,John Cleese, What a stroke of luck! 
26,John Cleese, Wait a minute! 
27,Carol Cleveland, What is it again? 
28,John Cleese," If this is the crew who were filming us . 
            .. who's filming us now? Look! "
29,Terry Jones, 
30,Eric Idle," Not so fast, Akarumba! Allow me to introduce 
            myself. I'm Inspector Baboon of Scotland Yard's Special Fraud Film 
            Director Squad, Jungle Division. "
31,Carol Cleveland, Baboon of the Yard! 
32,Eric Idle, Shut up! 
33,Eric Idle," (talc) And now on BBC another six 
            minutes of Monty Python's Flying Circus."
0,Michael Palin," Ah. I'd like to have an argument, please."
1,Rita Davies, Certainly sir. Have you been here before?
2,Michael Palin," No, I haven't, this is my first time."
3,Rita Davies," I see. Well, do you want to have just one 
            argument, or were you thinking of taking a course?"
4,Michael Palin," Well, what is the cost?"
5,Rita Davies," Well, It's one pound for a five minute 
            argument, but only eight pounds for a course of ten."
6,Michael Palin," Well, I think it would be best if I perhaps started 
            off with just the one and then see how it goes."
7,Rita Davies," Fine. Well, I'll see who's free at the 
            moment."
8,Rita Davies," Mr. DeBakey's free, but he's a little bit 
            conciliatory. Ahh yes, Try Mr. Barnard; room 12."
9,Michael Palin, Thank you.
10,Graham Chapman, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
11,Michael Palin," Well, I was told outside that..."
12,Graham Chapman," Don't give me that, you snotty-faced heap of 
            parrot droppings!"
13,Michael Palin, What?
14,Graham Chapman," Shut your festering gob, you tit! Your type 
            really makes me puke, you vacuous, coffee-nosed, malodorous, 
            pervert!!!"
15,Michael Palin," Look, I CAME HERE FOR AN ARGUMENT, I'm not going to 
            just stand...!!"
16,Graham Chapman," OH, oh I'm sorry, but this is abuse."
17,Michael Palin," Oh, I see, well, that explains it."
18,Graham Chapman," Ah yes, you want room 12A, Just along the 
            corridor."
19,Michael Palin," Oh, Thank you very much. Sorry."
20,Graham Chapman, Not at all.
21,Michael Palin, Thank You. 
22,Michael Palin, (Knock)
23,John Cleese, Come in.
24,Michael Palin," Ah, Is this the right room for an argument?"
25,John Cleese, I told you once.
26,Michael Palin, No you haven't.
27,John Cleese, Yes I have.
28,Michael Palin, When?
29,John Cleese, Just now.
30,Michael Palin, No you didn't.
31,John Cleese, Yes I did.
32,Michael Palin, You didn't
33,John Cleese, I did!
34,Michael Palin, You didn't!
35,John Cleese, I'm telling you I did!
36,Michael Palin, You did not!!
37,John Cleese," Oh, I'm sorry, just one moment. Is this a 
            five minute argument or the full half hour?"
38,Michael Palin," Oh, just the five minutes."
39,John Cleese," Ah, thank you. Anyway, I did."
40,Michael Palin, You most certainly did not.
41,John Cleese," Look, let's get this thing clear; I quite 
            definitely told you."
42,Michael Palin, No you did not.
43,John Cleese, Yes I did.
44,Michael Palin, No you didn't.
45,John Cleese, Yes I did.
46,Michael Palin, No you didn't.
47,John Cleese, Yes I did.
48,Michael Palin, No you didn't.
49,John Cleese, Yes I did.
50,Michael Palin, You didn't.
51,John Cleese, Did.
52,Michael Palin," Oh look, this isn't an argument."
53,John Cleese, Yes it is.
54,Michael Palin, No it isn't. It's just contradiction.
55,John Cleese, No it isn't.
56,Michael Palin, It is!
57,John Cleese, It is not.
58,Michael Palin," Look, you just contradicted me."
59,John Cleese, I did not.
60,Michael Palin, Oh you did!!
61,John Cleese," No, no, no."
62,Michael Palin, You did just then.
63,John Cleese, Nonsense!
64,Michael Palin," Oh, this is futile!"
65,John Cleese, No it isn't.
66,Michael Palin, I came here for a good argument.
67,John Cleese," No you didn't; no, you came here for an 
            argument."
68,Michael Palin, An argument isn't just contradiction.
69,John Cleese, It can be.
70,Michael Palin," No it can't. An argument is a connected series of 
            statements intended to establish a proposition."
71,John Cleese, No it isn't.
72,Michael Palin, Yes it is! It's not just contradiction.
73,John Cleese," Look, if I argue with you, I must take up a 
            contrary position. "
74,Michael Palin," Yes, but that's not just saying 'No it isn't.'"
75,John Cleese, Yes it is!
76,Michael Palin, No it isn't!
77,Michael Palin," Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is 
            just the automatic gainsaying of any statement the other person 
            makes."
78,John Cleese, No it isn't.
79,Michael Palin, It is.
80,John Cleese, Not at all.
81,Michael Palin, Now look.
82,John Cleese, 
83,Michael Palin, What?
84,John Cleese, That's it. Good morning.
85,Michael Palin, I was just getting interested.
86,John Cleese," Sorry, the five minutes is up."
87,Michael Palin, That was never five minutes!
88,John Cleese, I'm afraid it was.
89,Michael Palin, It wasn't.
90,John Cleese," I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to argue 
            anymore."
91,Michael Palin, What?!
92,John Cleese," If you want me to go on arguing, you'll 
            have to pay for another five minutes."
93,Michael Palin," Yes, but that was never five minutes, just now. Oh 
            come on!"
94,John Cleese, 
95,Michael Palin," Look, this is ridiculous."
96,John Cleese," I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to argue 
            unless you've paid!"
97,Michael Palin," Oh, all right."
98,John Cleese, Thank you. 
99,Michael Palin, Well?
100,John Cleese, Well what?
101,Michael Palin," That wasn't really five minutes, just now."
102,John Cleese," I told you, I'm not allowed to argue unless 
            you've paid."
103,Michael Palin, I just paid!
104,John Cleese, No you didn't.
105,Michael Palin, I DID!
106,John Cleese, No you didn't.
107,Michael Palin," Look, I don't want to argue about that."
108,John Cleese," Well, you didn't pay."
109,Michael Palin," Aha. If I didn't pay, why are you arguing? I Got you!"
110,John Cleese, No you haven't.
111,Michael Palin," Yes I have. If you're arguing, I must have paid."
112,John Cleese," Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my 
            spare time."
113,Michael Palin, Oh I've had enough of this.
114,John Cleese, No you haven't.
115,Michael Palin, Oh Shut up.
116,Michael Palin, I want to complain.
117,Eric Idle," You want to complain! Look at these shoes. 
            I've only had them three weeks and the heels are worn right through."
118,Michael Palin," No, I want to complain about..."
119,Eric Idle," If you complain nothing happens, you might as 
            well not bother."
120,Michael Palin, Oh!
121,Eric Idle," Oh my back hurts, it's not a very fine day and 
            I'm sick and tired of this office."
122,Michael Palin, 
123,Terry Jones," No, no, no. Hold your head like this, then go 
            Waaah. Try it again. "
124,Michael Palin, uuuwwhh!!
125,Terry Jones," Better, Better, but Waah, Waah! Put your hand 
            there."
126,Michael Palin, No.
127,Terry Jones, Now..
128,Michael Palin, Waaaaah!!!
129,Terry Jones," Good, Good! That's it."
130,Michael Palin, Stop hitting me!!
131,Terry Jones, What?
132,Michael Palin, Stop hitting me!!
133,Terry Jones, Stop hitting you?
134,Michael Palin, Yes!
135,Terry Jones, Why did you come in here then?
136,Michael Palin, I wanted to complain.
137,Terry Jones," Oh no, that's next door. It's 
            being-hit-on-the-head lessons in here."
138,Michael Palin, What a stupid concept.
0,Graham Chapman, Right. Hold it there. 
1,Michael Palin, What? 
2,Graham Chapman," Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Inspector 
            Fox of the Light Entertainment Police, Comedy Division, Special 
            Flying Squad. "

5,Michael Palin, Ooooh? 
6,Terry Jones," No, no, no - Waagh! "
7,Graham Chapman, And you. 
8,Terry Jones, Waagh! 
9,Graham Chapman," He's good! You could learn a thing or two 
            from him. Right now you two me old beauties, you are nicked. "
10,Michael Palin, What for? 
11,Graham Chapman," I'm charging you two under Section 21 of 
            the Strange Sketch Act. "
12,Michael Palin, The what? 
13,Graham Chapman," You are hereby charged that you did 
            willfully take part in a strange sketch, that is, a skit, spoof or 
            humorous vignette of an unconventional nature with intent to cause 
            grievous mental confusion to the Great British Public. "
14,Terry Jones, It's a fair cop. 
15,Graham Chapman, And you tosh. 
16,Michael Palin, WAAAGH! 
17,Graham Chapman," That's excellent! Right, come on down the 
            Yard. "
18,Eric Idle," Hold it. Hold it. Allow me to introduce 
            myself. I'm Inspector Thompson's Gazelle of the program Planning 
            Police, Light Entertainment Division, Special Flying Squad. "
19,Graham Chapman, Flying Thompson's Gazelle of the Yard! 
20,Eric Idle, Shut up! 
21,Graham Chapman, Waaaagh! 
22,Terry Jones, He's good. 
23,Eric Idle, Shut up! 
24,Terry Jones, WAAGH! 
25,Michael Palin, Rotten. 
26,Graham Chapman," Good. Now I'm 'arrestin' this entire show on 
            three counts: one, acts of self-conscious behavior contrary to the 
            'Not in front of the children' Act, two, always saying 'It's so and 
            so of the Yard' every time the fuzz arrives and, three, and this is 
            the cruncher, offences against the 'Getting out of sketches without 
            using a proper punchline' Act, four, namely, simply ending every 
            bleedin' sketch by just having a policeman come in and... wait a 
            minute. "
27,John Cleese, Hold it. 
28,Graham Chapman, It's a fair cop.

11,Eric Idle," Sey, sey - taht si crreoct, er - ta the mnemot I'm 
            wroking on ""The Mating of the Wersh""."
12,Michael Palin," ""The Mating of the Wersh""? By William 
            Shakespeare?"
13,Eric Idle," Nay, by Malliwi Rapesheake."
14,Michael Palin, And what else?
15,Eric Idle," ""Two Netlemeng of Verona"", ""Twelfth Thing"", ""The 
            Chamrent of Venice""...."
16,Michael Palin," Have you done ""Hamlet""?"
17,Eric Idle," ""Thamle"". 'Be ot or bot ne ot, tath is the nestquoi.'"
18,Michael Palin, And what is your next project?
19,Eric Idle," ""Ring Kichard the Thrid""."
20,Michael Palin, I'm sorry?
21,Eric Idle, 'A shroe! A shroe! My dingkom for a shroe!'
22,Michael Palin," Ah, Ring Kichard, yes... but surely that's 
            not an anagram, that's a spoonerism."
23,Eric Idle," If you're going to split hairs, I'm going to piss 
            off. "
0,John Cleese, Tony M. Nyphot's Flying Risccu. 
1,John Cleese," Mrs. Scab, you have twelve hours to beat the 
            clock. "
2,John Cleese, Correct! 
3,Graham Chapman," I've done it. I've done it. Ha, ha, ha! "
0,John Cleese," Hello? Ah, Mr. Victim, I'm glad to say that 
            I've got the go-ahead to lend you the money you require. Yes, of 
            course we will want as security the deeds of your house, of your 
            aunt's house, of your second cousin's house, of your wife's parents' 
            house, and of your grannie's bungalow, and we will in addition need 
            a controlling interest in your new company, unrestricted access to 
            your private bank account, the deposit in our vaults of your three 
            children as hostages and a full legal indemnity against any acts of 
            embezzlement carried out against you by any members of our staff 
            during the normal course of their duties... no, I'm afraid we 
            couldn't accept your dog instead of your youngest child, we would 
            like to suggest a brand new scheme of ours under which 51% of both 
            your dog and your wife pass to us in the event of your suffering a 
            serious accident. Fine. No, not at all, nice to do business with 
            you. "
1,Terry Jones, That's right. 
2,John Cleese, How do you do. I'm a merchant banker. 
3,Terry Jones, How do you do Mr... 
4,John Cleese," Er... I forget my name for the moment but I am 
            a merchant banker. "
5,Terry Jones," Oh. I wondered whether you'd like to contribute 
            to the orphan's home. "
6,John Cleese," Well I don't want to show my hand too early, 
            but actually here at Slater Nazi we are quite keen to get into 
            orphans, you know, developing market and all that... what son of sum 
            did you have in mind? "
7,Terry Jones, Well... er... you're a rich man. 
8,John Cleese," Yes, I am. Yes. Yes, very very rich. Quite 
            phenomenally wealthy. Yes, I do own the most startling quantifies of 
            cash. Yes, quite right... you're rather a smart young lad aren't 
            you. We could do with somebody like you to feed the pantomime horse. 
            Very smart. "
9,Terry Jones," Thank you, sir. "
10,John Cleese," Now, you were saying. I'm very, very, very, 
            very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very rich. "
11,Terry Jones," So er, how about a pound? "
12,John Cleese," A pound. Yes, I see. Now this loan would be 
            secured by the... "
13,Terry Jones," It's not a loan, sir. "
14,John Cleese, What? 
15,Terry Jones, It's not a loan. 
16,John Cleese, Ah. 
17,Terry Jones," You get one of these, sir. "
18,John Cleese," It's a bit small for a share certificate isn't 
            it? Look, I think I'd better run this over to our legal department. 
            If you could possibly pop back on Friday. "
19,Terry Jones," Well do you have to do that, couldn't you just 
            give me the pound? "
20,John Cleese," Yes, but you see I don't know what it's for.
            "
21,Terry Jones, It's for the orphans. 
22,John Cleese, Yes? 
23,Terry Jones, It's a gift. 
24,John Cleese, A what? 
25,Terry Jones, A gift? 
26,John Cleese, Oh a gift! 
27,Terry Jones, Yes. 
28,John Cleese, A tax dodge. 
29,Terry Jones," No, no, no, no. "
30,John Cleese," No? Well, I'm awfully sorry I don't understand. 
            Can you just explain exactly what you want. "
31,Terry Jones," Well, I want you to give me a pound, and then I 
            go away and give it to the orphans. "
32,John Cleese, Yes? 
33,Terry Jones," Well, that's it. "
34,John Cleese," No, no, no, I don't follow this at all, I mean, 
            I don't want to seem stupid but it looks to me as though I'm a pound 
            down on the whole deal. "
35,Terry Jones," Well, yes you are. "
36,John Cleese," I am! Well, what is my incentive to give you 
            the pound? "
37,Terry Jones," Well the incentive is - to make the orphans 
            happy. "
38,John Cleese, 
39,Terry Jones," Yes, lots of people give me money. "
40,John Cleese," What, just like that? "
41,Terry Jones, Yes. 
42,John Cleese," Must be sick. I don't suppose you could give me 
            a list of their names and addresses could you? "
43,Terry Jones," No, I just go up to them in the street and ask.
            "
44,John Cleese," Good lord! That's the most exciting new idea 
            I've heard in years! It's so simple it's brilliant! Well, if that 
            idea of yours isn't worth a pound I'd like to know what is. "
45,Terry Jones," Oh, thank you, sir. "
46,John Cleese," The only trouble is, you gave me the idea 
            before I'd given you the pound. And that's not good business. "
47,Terry Jones, Isn't it? 
48,John Cleese," No, I'm afraid it isn't. So, um, off you go. "
0,John Cleese, Now I've asked you to ... 
1,John Cleese, 
0,John Cleese," Sketch just starting, actor wanted. "
1,Eric Idle, Good morning. 
2,Graham Chapman," Morning, sir. "
3,Eric Idle, I'd like to join the army please. 
4,Eric Idle, As long as possible please. 
5,Graham Chapman," Right well I'll just take a few particulars and 
            then... "
6,Graham Chapman, Shove off! 
7,Eric Idle," Yes. Yes, yes I see. "
8,Graham Chapman," The Women's Royal Army Corps, sir? "
9,Eric Idle," Yes. I was just thinking, you know, if it was 
            possible for me to have my choice ... I'd prefer to be in the 
            Women's Royal Amy Corps. "
10,Graham Chapman," Well, I'm afraid that the people that recruit here 
            normally go straight into the Scots Guards. "
11,Eric Idle, Which is all... men... I suppose? 
12,Graham Chapman, Yes it is. 
13,Eric Idle," Yes. Are there any regiments which are more 
            effeminate than others? "
14,Graham Chapman," Well, no sir. I mean, apart from the Marines, 
            they're all dead butch. "
15,Eric Idle," You see, what I really wanted was a regiment 
            where I could be really quiet and have more time to myself m work 
            with fabrics, and creating new concepts in interior design. "
16,Graham Chapman," Working with fabrics and experimenting with 
            interior design! "
17,Eric Idle, Yes. 
18,Graham Chapman," Oh well you want the Durham Light Infantry then, 
            sir. "
19,Eric Idle, Oh. 
20,Graham Chapman," Oh yes. That's the only regiment that's really 
            doing something new with interior design, with color, texture, line 
            and that. "
21,Eric Idle, I see. 
22,Graham Chapman," Oh yes, I mean their use of color with fabrics is 
            fantastic. I saw their pattern book the other day - beautiful, 
            beautiful. Savage tans, great slabs of black, set against aggressive 
            orange. It really makes you want to shout out, this is good! This is 
            real! "
23,Eric Idle, Really? 
24,Graham Chapman," Oh yes. I mean the Inniskillin Fusiliers and the 
            Anglian Regiment are all right if you're interested in the art 
            nouveau William Morris revival bit, but if you really want a 
            regiment of the line that is really saying something about interior 
            decor, then you've got to go for the Durham Light Infantry. "
25,Eric Idle," Oh, I've had enough of this. I'm handing in my 
            notice. "
26,Graham Chapman, What do you mean? 
27,Eric Idle," Well I 'mean, when I applied for this job I 
            thought I'd get a few decent lines but you end up doing the whole 
            thing. I mean my last five speeches have been 'really, really - I 
            see - I see' and 'really'. I wouldn't give those lines to a dog. "
28,Graham Chapman," All right, all right, all right, sonny. I'll tell 
            you what. We'll do something different. I'll be a bus conductor, and 
            you can be a really funny passenger on a bus."
0,Eric Idle, Fivepenny please. 
1,Eric Idle, Look! 
2,Eric Idle," Look! You said I was going to be a funny 
            passenger. "
3,Eric Idle," I mean, all I said was, fivepenny please, You 
            can't call that a funny line. "
4,Eric Idle," No it isn't. Nobody can say 'fivepenny please' 
            and make it funny. "
0,Terry Jones, Fivepenny please. 
1,Terry Jones, Morning. 
2,Terry Jones," Not so warm today, George. "
3,Terry Jones, Voice Good morning. 
4,Michael Palin," Come in, Mr. Horton. "
5,Terry Jones," Morning, sir. "
6,Michael Palin, Do - do sit down. 
7,Terry Jones," Thank you, sir. "
8,Michael Palin," Now then Horton, you've been with us for twenty 
            years, and your work in the accounts department has been immaculate
            "
9,Terry Jones, 
0,Michael Palin," Good evening. Well tonight, we are going to 
            talk about... well that is... I am going to talk about... well 
            actually I am talking about it now... well I'm not talking about it 
            now, but I am talking... I know I'm pausing occasionally, and not 
            talking during the pauses, but the pauses are pan of the whole 
            process of talking... when one talks one has to pause... er ... like 
            then! I paused ... but I was still talking ... and again there! No 
            the real point of what I'm saying is that when I appear not to be 
            talking don't go nipping out to the kitchen, putting the kettle on 
            ... buttering scones... or getting crumbs and bits of food out of 
            those round brown straw mats that the teapot goes on... because in 
            all probability I'm still talking and what you heard was a pause ... 
            er ... like there again. Look! To make it absolutely easier, so 
            there's no problem at all, what I'll do, I'll give you some kind of 
            sign, like this "
1,Michael Palin," No, no! No sorry - just demonstrating... 
            haven't finished. Haven't started yet. "
2,Eric Idle, 
3,Michael Palin, ... with a large piece of wet paper. 
4,Eric Idle, 
0,Jon Cleese, 
1,Carol Cleveland, Hello. 
2,Jon Cleese," ... has not been able to announce since our 
            youngest, Clifford, was born, and, well, "
3,Michael Palin," Hello, I'm another announcer, my name's Dick. 
            Joe-jums just rang me and said Jack was having a bad time with this 
            announcement, so I've just come to give him a hand. How is he, 
            Joe-jums? "
4,Carol Cleveland," Pretty bad, Dick. "
5,Michael Palin," Jack ... it's Dick ... Do you want me to make the 
            announcement? "
6,Jon Cleese," No, no Dick. I must do it myself... "
7,Michael Palin," Good man. Now remember your announcer's training: 
            deep breaths, and try not to think about what you're saying... "
8,Jon Cleese, Good evening. This 
9,Carol Cleveland," Good luck, Jack. "
10,Michael Palin," Keep going, old boy. "
11,Jon Cleese," It's ... nine o'clock ... and ... time ... for ... 
            the News ... read by ... Richard Baker... "
12,Carol Cleveland, You've done it. 
13,Michael Palin," Congratulations, old man! "
14,Carol Cleveland," Fantastic darling, you were brilliant. No, no, 
            it was the best you ever did. "
15,Jon Cleese, Thank God. 
16,Carol Cleveland, It was absolutely super. 
17,Michael Palin, ... have a drink. For God's sake drink this... 
18,Jon Cleese, Fantastic. 
19,Michael Palin, The least I could do - super - I must come over. 
20,Jon Cleese, I can't tell you how much that means. 
21,Richard Baker," ... until the name Maudling is almost totally 
            obscured. That is the ned of the micro-not wens. And now it's time 
            for the late night film."
0,Carol Cleveland," Oh pantomime horse, that was wonderful. - "
1,Carol Cleveland," No, no, I mustn't. It makes me throw up... oh, I'm 
            so bleeding happy. "
2,Carol Cleveland," Oh, pantomime horse. "
3,Graham Chapman, Then... 
4,John Cleese," And now the English pantomime horse has very 
            nearly caught up with the Russian pantomime horse, I think he's 
            going to take him any moment now but what is this? What is this? "
5,John Cleese, 
0,Eric Idle," Good evening, and welcome to the Arthur Ludlow 
            Memorial Baths, Newport, for this year's finals of the All-England 
            Summarize Proust Competition. "
1,Terry Jones," (TERRY J) Good evening and welcome, whereas Proust 
            would say, 'la malade imaginaire de recondition et de toute 
            surveillance est bientôt la même chose'. "
2,Graham Chapman," Proust's novel ostensibly tells of the 
            irrevocability of time lost, the forfeiture of innocence through 
            experience, the reinstatement of extra-temporal values of time 
            regained, ultimately the novel is both optimistic and set within the 
            context of a humane religious experience, re-stating as it does the 
            concept of intemporality. in the first volume, Swarm, the family 
            friend visits... "
3,Terry Jones," Well tried, Harry. "
4,Eric Idle," A good attempt there but unfortunately he 
            chose a general appraisal of the work, before getting on to the 
            story and as you can see "
5,Terry Jones," Harry: Bagot, you're from Luton? "
6,Graham Chapman," Yes, Arthur, yeah. "
7,Terry Jones," Now Harry what made you first want to try and start 
            summarizing Proust "
8,Graham Chapman," Well I first entered a seaside Summarizing Proust 
            Competition when I was on holiday in Bournemouth, and my doctor 
            encouraged me with it. "
9,Terry Jones," And Harry, what are your hobbies outside summarizing?
            "
10,Graham Chapman," Well, strangling animals, golf and masturbating.
            "
11,Terry Jones," Well, thank you Harry Bagot. "
12,Graham Chapman, walks off-stage. Music and applause. 
13,Eric Idle," Well there he goes. Harry Bagot. He must have 
            let himself down a bit on the hobbies, golf's not very popular 
            around here, but never mind, a good try. "
14,Terry Jones," Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Rutherford from 
            Leicester, are you ready Ronald? "
15,Michael Palin," Er, well, Swann, Swann, there's this house, 
            there's this house, and er, it's in the morning, it's in the morning 
            - no, it's the evening, in the evening and er, there's a garden and 
            er, this bloke comes in - bloke comes in - what's his name - what's 
            his name, er just said it - big bloke - Swarm, Swarm "
16,Terry Jones," And now ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to welcome 
            the last of our all-England finalists this evening, from Bingley, 
            the Bolton Choral Society and their leader Superintendent McGough, 
            (a big choir comes on, immaculately drilled, each holding a score, 
            with Fred Tomlinson as superintendent McGough) All right Bingley, 
            remember you've got fifteen seconds to summarize Proust in his 
            entirety starting from now. "
17,Eric Idle," Very ambitious try there, but in fact the 
            least successful of the evening, they didn't even get as far as the 
            first volume. "
18,Terry Jones," Well ladies and gentlemen, I don't think any of our 
            contestants this evening have succeeded in encapsulating the 
            intricacies of Proust's masterwork, so I'm going to award the first 
            prize this evening to the girl with the biggest tits. "
0,Michael Palin," Mount Everest. Forbidding, aloof, terrifying. 
            The mountain with the biggest tits in the world."
1,Eric Idle, Start again!
2,Michael Palin," Mount Everest. Forbidding, aloof, terrifying. 
            This year, this remote Himalayan mountain, this mystical temple, 
            surrounded by the most difficult terrain in the world, repulsed yet 
            another attempt to conquer it. "
3,Michael Palin," Well, people keep taking your hairdryer on 
            every turn."
4,Graham Chapman, There's a lot of bitching in the tents.
5,Eric Idle, You couldn't get near the mirror.
6,Michael Palin," The leader of the expedition was Colonel Sir 
            John Cheesy-Weezy Butler, veteran K2, Annapurna, and Vidal. His plan 
            was to ignore the usual route around the south and to make straight 
            for the top."
7,Graham Chapman," We established Base Salon here, and climbed quite 
            steadily up to Mario's, here. From here, using crampons and cutting 
            ice steps as we went, we moved steadily up the face to the north 
            ridge, establishing Camp Three, where we could get a hot meal, a 
            manicure, and a shampoo and set."
8,Michael Palin," Could it work? Could this 18-year old 
            hairdresser from Brixton succeed where others had failed? The 
            situation was complicated by the imminent arrival of the monsoon 
            storms. Patrice takes up the story."
9,Eric Idle," Well, we knew as well as anyone that the monsoons 
            were due. But the thing was, Ricky and I had just had a blow dry and 
            rinse, and we couldn't go out for a couple of days."
10,Michael Palin," After a blazing row, the Germans and Italians 
            had turned back, taking with them the last of the hairnets. On the 
            third day, a blizzard blew up. Temperatures fell to minus 30 degrees 
            centigrade. Inside the little tent, things were getting desperate."
11,Michael Palin," Well, things have gotten so bad that we've been 
            forced to use the last of the heavy oxygen equipment just to keep 
            the dryers going. "
12,Michael Palin," But a new factor had entered the race. A team 
            of French chiropodists, working with brand new corn plasters and Dr. 
            Scholl's Mountaineering Sandals, were close behind. The Glasgow 
            Orpheus male voice choir were tackling the difficult north part. All 
            together, fourteen expeditions were at the scene. This was it. Ricky 
            had to make a decision."
13,Eric Idle," Well, he decided to open a salon."
14,Michael Palin, It was a tremendous success.
15,Eric Idle," Challenging Everest? Why not drop in at 
            Ricky Pule's, only 2400 feet from this cinema. "
0,Terry Jones," Hello, is that the fire brigade? "
1,Michael Palin," No, sorry, wrong number. "
2,Eric Idle," That phone's not stopped ringing all day.
            "
3,Michael Palin," No, no, you put them in separately when the 
            vine leaves are ready. "
4,Eric Idle," Oh, no, not again. "
5,Terry Jones, I can't get the fire brigade Mervyn. 
6,John Cleese," Here, let me try, dear. You go and play the cello.
            "
7,Terry Jones," Oh it doesn't do any good, dear. "
8,John Cleese," Look. Do you want the little hamster to live or 
            not? "
9,Terry Jones," Yes I do, Mervyn. "
10,John Cleese, Well go and play the cello! 
11,John Cleese," Hello, hello, operator? Yes we're trying to get 
            the fire brigade ... No, the fire brigade. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, 
            yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, what? ... "
12,Terry Jones, 
13,John Cleese, What? 
14,Terry Jones, He's slipped away. 
15,John Cleese, What? 
16,Terry Jones, The sodding hamster's dead! 
17,John Cleese, 
18,Terry Jones," Some Mozart concertos, dear. "
19,John Cleese, What... How did he... ? 
20,Terry Jones," His eyes just closed, and he fell into the 
            wastepaper basket. I've covered him with a copy of the 'Charlie 
            George Football Book'. "
21,John Cleese, 
22,Terry Jones," There was nothing we could do, Mervyn. If 
            we'd have had the whole Philharmonic Orchestra in there, he'd still 
            have gone. "
23,John Cleese," I'm going upstairs, I can't bear it. "
24,Terry Jones, 
25,John Cleese, Dam. 
26,Terry Jones, 
27,John Cleese, 
28,Terry Jones," No, he doesn't want anyone at the moment, 
            thank you. No, yes, yes, no thank you for trying, yes, yes, ... no, 
            Saxones, yes, yes thank you, bye, bye. "
29,Graham Chapman," Mummy, "
30,Terry Jones, Eamonn. 
31,Graham Chapman," Well, things is pretty bad there at the moment but 
            there does seem some hope of a constitutional settlement. "
32,Terry Jones," Oh don't talk. Let me just look at you, "
33,Graham Chapman," Great to be home, mummy. How are you? "
34,Terry Jones," Oh, I'm fine. I must just go upstairs and get 
            your room ready. "
35,Graham Chapman," It's a bungalow, mummy. "
36,Terry Jones," Oh dam, yes. Mervyn, Mervyn - look who's 
            here, it's our Eamonn come back to see us. "
37,John Cleese," Hello, Eamonn. "
38,Graham Chapman," Hello, Merv. "
39,John Cleese, How was Dublin? 
40,Graham Chapman," Well as I was telling mummy here, things is pretty 
            bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a 
            constitutional settlement. "
41,John Cleese, 
42,Terry Jones," Oh no, Thursday's the Industrial Relations 
            Bill Dinner Dance. Can't they make it another day? "
43,John Cleese, 
44,Michael Palin," And so it was the fire brigade eventually came 
            round on Friday night. "
45,Terry Jones," Oh, so glad you could come. What would you 
            like to drink? Gin and tonic? Sherry? "
46,Michael Palin, 
47,Michael Palin," Well, how was Dublin, Eamonn? "
48,Graham Chapman," Well, as I was telling mummy and Mervyn earlier, 
            things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some 
            hope of a constitutional... "
49,Terry Jones, 
0,Eric Idle," Hello, last week on 'Party Hints' I showed you 
            how to make a small plate of goulash go round twenty-six people, how 
            to get the best out of your canapés, and how to unblock your loo. 
            This week I'm going to tell you what to do if there is an armed 
            communist uprising near your home when you're having a party. Well 
            obviously it'll depend how far you've got with your party when the 
            signal for Red Revolt is raised. If you're just having preliminary 
            aperitifs - Dubonnet, a sherry or a sparkling white wine - then the 
            guests will obviously be in a fairly formal mood and it will be 
            difficult to tell which are the communist agitators. So the thing to 
            do is to get some cloth and some bits of old paper, put it down on 
            the floor and shoot everybody. This will deal with the Red Menace on 
            your own doorstep. If you're having canapés, as I showed you last 
            week, or an outdoor barbecue, then the thing to do is set fire to 
            all houses in the street. This will stir up anti-communist hatred 
            and your neighbors will be right with you as you organize 
            counter-revolutionary terror. So you see, if you act promptly . 
            enough, any left-wing uprising can be dealt with by the end of the 
            party. Bye..."

1,Terry Jones," I'm afraid I cannot comment on that until 
            it's been officially hushed up. "
2,Graham Chapman, This is our politicians' booth.

10,Michael Palin, Ee ecky thump! 
11,Graham Chapman, Excellent. 
12,Michael Palin," Thank you, sir. "
13,Graham Chapman, It's a really quick method of learning. 
14,Michael Palin, Can you smell gas or is it me? 
15,John Cleese, 
16,Graham Chapman, Very good. 
17,Graham Chapman," And we control everr,.hing from here. "
18,John Cleese, Superb. 
19,Graham Chapman," Well then what sort of thing were you looking 
            for? "
20,John Cleese," Well, er, really something to make me a little less 
            insignificant? "
21,Graham Chapman," Oh, I see sort of 'Now look here, you may be 
            Chairman but your bloody pusillanimous behavior makes me vomit!' 
            That sort of thing?... "
22,John Cleese," Oh no, no, no, not really no. "

            of Clive Jenkins-ish? Perhaps - sort of "
24,John Cleese," Oh no, I really want something that will make people 
            be attracted to me like a magnet. "
25,Graham Chapman," I see, well, you want our 'Life and Soul of the 
            Party' tape then, I think. "
26,John Cleese, What's that? 
27,Graham Chapman," Well it's sort of ""Ello squire, haven't seen you 
            for a bit, haven't seen you for a bit either, Beryl. Two pints of 
            wallop please, love. Still driving the Jensen then? Cheer up Jack it

0,Eric Idle, Good morning
1,Carol Cleveland," Oh good morning, Do you want to come upstairs?"
2,Eric Idle, What?
3,Carol Cleveland," Do you want to come upstairs? Or have you come 
            to arrange a holiday?"
4,Eric Idle, Er.......to arrange a holiday
5,Carol Cleveland, Oh sorry
6,Eric Idle, What's all this about going upstairs?
7,Carol Cleveland," Oh, nothing, nothing. Now where were you 
            thinking of going?"
8,Eric Idle, India
9,Carol Cleveland, Ah one of our adventure holidays
10,Eric Idle, Yes
11,Carol Cleveland," Well you'd better speaker to Mr. Bounder about 
            that. "
12,Michael Palin, Ah good morning. I'm Bounder of Adventure
13,Eric Idle, My name is Smoke-too-much
14,Michael Palin, Well you'd better cut down a little then
15,Eric Idle, What?
16,Michael Palin, You'd better cut down a little then
17,Eric Idle, Oh I see! Cut down a little then.....
18,Michael Palin," Yes...I expect you get people making jokes about 
            your name all the time?"
19,Eric Idle," No, no actually it never struck me before. 
            Smoke...to...much...."
20,Michael Palin," Anyway you're interested in one of our adventure 
            holidays?"
21,Eric Idle, Yes I saw your advert in the bolour supplement
22,Michael Palin, The what?
23,Eric Idle, The bolour supplement
24,Michael Palin, The color supplement?
25,Eric Idle, Yes I'm sorry I can't say the letter 'B'
26,Michael Palin, C?
27,Eric Idle," Yes that's right. It's all due to a trauma I 
            suffered when I was a schoolboy. I was attacked by a bat"
28,Michael Palin, A cat?
29,Eric Idle, No a bat
30,Michael Palin, Can you say the letter 'K'
31,Eric Idle," Oh yes, Khaki, king, kettle, Kuwait, Keble 
            Bollege Oxford"
32,Michael Palin," Why don't you say the letter 'K' instead of the 
            letter 'C'"
33,Eric Idle, what you mean.....spell bolour with a K
34,Michael Palin, Yes
35,Eric Idle," Kolour. Oh that's very good, I never thought of 
            that what a silly bunt"
36,Michael Palin, Anyway about the holiday
37,Eric Idle," Well I saw your adverts in the paper and I've 
            been on package tours several times you see, and I decided that this 
            was for me"
38,Michael Palin, Ah good
39,Eric Idle," Yes I quite agree I mean what's the point of 
            being treated like sheep. What's the point of going abroad if you're 
            just another tourist carted around in buses surrounded by sweaty 
            mindless oafs from Kettering and Coventry in their cloth caps and 
            their cardigans and their transistor radios and their Sunday 
            Mirrors, complaining about the tea - ""Oh they don't make it properly 
            here, do they, not like at home"" - and stopping at Majorcan bodegas 
            selling fish and chips and Watney's Red Barrel and calamari's and 
            two veg and sitting in their cotton frocks squirting Timothy White's 
            sun cream all over their puffy raw swollen purulent flesh 'cos they 
            ""overdid it on the first day."" "
40,Michael Palin, 
41,Eric Idle," And being herded into endless Hotel Miramars and 
            Bellvueses and Continentales with their modern international luxury 
            roomettes and draught Red Barrel and swimming pools full of fat 
            German businessmen pretending they're acrobats forming pyramids and 
            frightening the children and barging into queues and if you're not 
            at your table spot on seven you miss the bowl of Campbell's Cream of 
            Mushroom soup, the first item on the menu of International Cuisine, 
            and every Thursday night the hotel has a bloody cabaret in the bar, 
            featuring a tiny emaciated dago with nine-inch hips and some bloated 
            fat tart with her hair brylcreemed down and a big arse presenting 
            Flamenco for Foreigners."
42,Michael Palin, 
43,Eric Idle," And then some adenoidal typists from Birmingham 
            with flabby white legs and diarrhea trying to pick up hairy 
            bandy-legged wop waiters called Manuel and once a week there's an 
            excursion to the local Roman Remains to buy cherryade and melted ice 
            cream and bleeding Watney's Red Barrel and one evening you visit the 
            so called typical restaurant with local color and atmosphere and 
            you sit next to a party from Rhyl who keep singing ""Torremolinos, 
            torremolinos"" and complaining about the food - ""It's so greasy isn't 
            it?"" - and you get cornered by some drunken greengrocer from Luton 
            with an Instamatic camera and Dr. Scholl sandals and last Tuesday's 
            Daily Express and he drones on and on about how Mr. Smith should be 
            running this country and how many languages Enoch Powell can speak 
            and then he throws up over the Cuba Libres. "
44,Michael Palin, Will you be quiet please
45,Eric Idle," And sending tinted postcards of places they don't 
            realize they haven't even visited to ""All at number 22, weather 
            wonderful, our room is marked with an 'X'. "
46,Michael Palin, Shut up
47,Eric Idle," Food very greasy but we've found a charming 
            little local place hidden away in the back streets "
48,Michael Palin, Shut up!
49,Eric Idle," where they serve Watney's Red Barrel and cheese 
            and onion......."
50,Michael Palin, Shut up your bloody gob....
51,Eric Idle," crisps and the accordionist plays 'Maybe it's 
            because I'm a Londoner'."" And spending four days on the tarmac at 
            Luton airport on a five-day package tour with nothing to eat but 
            dried BEA-type sandwiches and you can't even get a drink of Watney's 
            Red Barrel because you're still in England and the bloody bar closes 
            every time you're thirsty and there's nowhere to sleep and the kids 
            are crying and vomiting and breaking the plastic ash-trays and they 
            keep telling you it'll only be another hour although your plane is 
            still in Iceland and has to take some Swedes to Yugoslavia before it 
            can load you up at 3 a.m. in the bloody morning and you sit on the 
            tarmac till six because of ""unforeseen difficulties"", i.e. the 
            permanent strike of Air Traffic Control in Paris - and nobody can go 
            to the lavatory until you take off at 8, and when you get to Malaga 
            airport everybody's swallowing ""enterovioform"" and queuing for the 
            toilets and queuing for the armed customs officers, and queuing for 
            the bloody bus that isn't there to take you to the hotel that hasn't 
            yet been finished. And when you finally get to the half-built 
            Algerian ruin called the Hotel del Sol by paying half your holiday 
            money to a licensed bandit in a taxi you find there's no water in 
            the pool, there's no water in the taps, there's no water in the bog 
            and there's only a bleeding lizard in the bidet. And half the rooms 
            are double booked and you can't sleep anyway because of the 
            permanent twenty-four-hour drilling of the foundations of the hotel 
            next door - and you're plagued by appalling apprentice chemists from 
            Ealing pretending to be hippies, and middle-class stockbrokers' 
            wives busily buying identical holiday villas in suburban development 
            plots just like Esher, in case the Labour government gets in again, 
            and fat American matrons with sloppy-buttocks and Hawaiian-patterned 
            ski pants looking for any mulatto male who can keep it up long 
            enough when they finally let it all flop out. And the Spanish 
            Tourist Board promises you that the raging cholera epidemic is 
            merely a case of mild Spanish tummy, like the previous outbreak of 
            Spanish tummy in 1660 which killed half London and decimated Europe 
            - and meanwhile the bloody Guardia are busy arresting 
            sixteen-year-olds for kissing in the streets and shooting anyone 
            under nineteen who doesn't like Franco. And then on the last day in 
            the airport lounge everyone's comparing sunburns, drinking Nasty 
            Spumante, buying cartons of duty free ""cigarillos"" and using up 
            their last pesetas on horrid dolls in Spanish National costume and 
            awful straw donkeys and bullfight posters with your name on 
            ""Ordoney, El Cordobes and Brian Pules of Norwich"" and 3-D pictures 
            of the Pope and Kennedy and Franco, and everybody's talking about 
            coming again next year and you swear you never will although there 
            you are tumbling bleary-eyed out of a tourist-tight antique Iberian 
            airplane..."
0,Graham Chapman," Good evening. Tonight: ""dinosaurs"". I have

            about the brontosaurus."
11,John Cleese," Can I just say here, Chris for one moment, that 
            I have a new theory about the brontosaurus?"
12,Graham Chapman, Uh... Exactly... What is it?
13,John Cleese, Where?
14,Graham Chapman," No! No, what is your theory?"
15,John Cleese, What is my theory?
16,Graham Chapman, Yes!
17,John Cleese," What is my theory that it is? Yes. Well, you may 
            well ask what is my theory."
18,Graham Chapman, I am asking.
19,John Cleese," And well you may. Yes, my word, you may well ask 
            what it is, this theory of mine. Well, this theory, that I have, 
            that is to say, which is mine,... is mine."
20,Graham Chapman, I know it's yours! What is it?
21,John Cleese, ... Where? ... Oh! Oh! What is my theory?
22,Graham Chapman, Yes!
23,John Cleese," Ahh! My theory, that I have, follows the lines 
            that I am about to relate. "

25,John Cleese," The Theory, by A. Elk (that's ""A"" for Anne"", 
            it's not by a elk.)"

30,Graham Chapman,

            much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the far end. That 
            is the theory that I have and which is mine and what it is, too."
32,Graham Chapman," That's it, is it?"
33,John Cleese," Right, Chris!"
34,Graham Chapman," Well, Anne, this theory of yours seems to have 
            hit the nail right on the head."
35,John Cleese, ... and it's mine.
36,Graham Chapman, Thank you for coming along to the studio.

32,Terry Jones," Disgraceful! I don't know how they've got the 
            nerve to put it on. "
33,Graham Chapman, It's so boring. 
34,John Cleese," Well ... it's not much of a subject is it ... be 
            fair. "
35,Graham Chapman," What do you think, George? "
36,Terry Jones, Give him another twenty seconds. 
37,John Cleese," Anyway the majority of the mollusks are included in 
            three large groups, the gastropods, the lamellibranchs and the 
            cephalopods... "
38,Graham Chapman, We knew that 
39,John Cleese," However, what is more interesting, er ... is the 
            mollusk's er ... sex life. "
40,Graham Chapman, 
41,John Cleese," Yes, the mollusk is a randy little fellow whose 
            primitive brain scarcely strays from the subject of the you know 
            what. "
42,Graham Chapman, 
43,Terry Jones, Ought not to be allowed. 
44,John Cleese," The randiest of the gastropods is the limpet. This 
            hot-blooded little beast with its tent-like shell is always on the 
            job. Its extra-marital activities are something startling. Frankly I 
            don't know how the female limpet finds the time to adhere to the 
            rock-face. How am I doing? "
45,Graham Chapman, Disgusting. 
46,Terry Jones, But more interesting. 
47,Graham Chapman," Oh yes, tch, tch, tch. "
48,John Cleese," Another loose-living gastropod is the periwinkle. 
            This shameless little libertine with its characteristic ventral 
            locomotion ... is not the marrying kind: Anywhere anytime is its 
            motto. Up with the shell and they're at it. "
49,Graham Chapman, How about the lamellibranchs? 
50,John Cleese, I'm coming to them ... the great scallop 
51,Graham Chapman, Have you got one? 
52,John Cleese, Here! 
53,Graham Chapman, Let's kill it. Disgusting. 
54,Terry Jones," That'll teach it. Well thank you for a very 
            interesting program. "
55,John Cleese," Oh, not at all. Thank you. "
56,Graham Chapman," Yes, that was very nice. "
57,John Cleese, Thank you. 
58,Graham Chapman," Oh, thank you. "
0,Michael Palin," The Minister for not listening to people 
            toured Batley today to investigate allegations of victimization in 
            home-loan improvement grants, made last week "
0,Michael Palin," He in turn has been revealed by D'Arcy as 
            something less than an honest man. Sybil feels once again a 
            resurgence of her old affection and she and Balreau return to her 
            little house in Clermont-Ferrand, the kind of two-up, two-down house 
            that most French workers throughout the European Community are 
            living in today. "
1,Eric Idle," The ease of construction, using on-site 
            prefabrication facilities "
2,Eric Idle," Where is Porky? Here he is. What a funny little 
            chap. "
3,Eric Idle," ... are dim reminders of the days before a 
            new-found affluence swept the land, "
4,Eric Idle," . .. and toys and shiny cars that go brrm,

            to start looking. "

0,John Cleese," Hello. All the activity you can see in 
            progress here is part of the intricate... aah! "
1,Graham Chapman," Well this is a completely uncharted lake with 
            like hitherto unclassified marine life man, so the whole scene's 
            wide open for a scientific exploration. "
2,John Cleese, 
3,Graham Chapman, 
4,John Cleese, 
5,John Cleese, 
6,Eric Idle, Right on. 
7,John Cleese," You've kept this all rather hush-hush so far 
            shipmate. "
8,Eric Idle," Yeah, it's been really heavy man with all 
            these freaks from the fascist press trying to blow the whole scene.
            "
9,John Cleese, 
10,Terry Jones," I'm sorry about my colleague's rather 
            unconventional behavior. "
11,Graham Chapman, 
12,Terry Jones," Hello. I'm sorry about my colleague's 
            rather unconventional behavior just now, but things haven't been tog 
            easy for him recently, trouble at home, rather confidential so I 
            can't give you all the details... interesting though they are... 
            three bottles of rum with his weetabix, and so on, anyway... 
            apparently the girl wasn't even ... anyway the activity you see 
            behind me... it's the mother I feel sorry for. I'll start again. The 
            activity you see behind me is part of the preparations for the new 
            Naval Expedition to Lake Pahoe. The man in charge of this expedition 
            is Vice Admiral Sir John Cunningham. Sir John, hello there. "
13,Graham Chapman," Ah, hello. Well first of all I'd like to 
            apologize for the behavior of certain of my colleagues you may have 
            seen earlier, but they are from broken homes, circus families and so 
            on and they are in no way representative of the new modern improved 
            British Navy. They are a small vociferous minority; and may I take 
            this opportunity of emphasizing that there is no cannibalism in the 
            British Navy. Absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is 
            a certain amount, more than we are prepared to admit, but all new 
            ratings are warned that if they wake up in the morning and find 
            tooth marks at all anywhere on their bodies, they're to tell me 
            immediately so that I can immediately take every measure to hush the 
            whole thing up. And, finally, necrophilia is right out. "
14,John Cleese, And where exactly is the lake? 
15,Graham Chapman," Er 22A, Runcorn Avenue, I think. Yes, that's 
            right, 22A. "
16,John Cleese, Runcorn Avenue? 
17,Graham Chapman," Yes, it's just by Blenheim Crescent... do you 
            know it? "
18,John Cleese, You mean it's in an ordinary street? 
19,Graham Chapman," Of course it's not an ordinary street! It's got 
            a lake in it! "
20,John Cleese, Yes but I... 
21,Graham Chapman," Look, how many streets do you know that have got 
            lakes in them? "
22,John Cleese, But you mean... is it very large? 
23,Graham Chapman," Of course it's not large, you couldn't get a 
            large lake in Runcorn Avenue! You'd have to knock down the 
            tobacconist's! "
24,John Cleese," I'm now standing in Runcorn Avenue. Sir John 
            ... where exactly is the lake? "
25,Graham Chapman," Er, well let's see, that's 18... that's 20 so 
            this must be the one. "
26,John Cleese," Er, excuse me... "
27,Graham Chapman," Yes, that's the one all right. "
28,John Cleese, But it's an ordinary house. 
29,Graham Chapman," Look, I'm getting pretty irritated with this 
            line of questioning. "
30,John Cleese, But it doesn't even look like a lake... 
31,Graham Chapman," Look, your whole approach since this interview 
            started has been to mock the Navy. When I think that it was for the 
            likes of you that I had both my legs blown off... "
32,John Cleese, 
33,Graham Chapman," I was talking metaphorically you fool. Jenkins - 
            put that down. "
34,Eric Idle, Diving equipment all ready man. 
35,Graham Chapman, 
36,Michael Palin, 
37,Graham Chapman, Good morning - I'm looking for a Lake Pahoe. 
38,Michael Palin, There's a Mr. Padgett. 
39,Graham Chapman," No, no a lake. "
40,Michael Palin," There's no lake here, mate. This is Runcorn Avenue. 
            What's the camera doing? "
41,Eric Idle, 
42,Michael Palin, He's looking for a lake. 
43,Graham Chapman, Lake Pahoe. 
44,Eric Idle," Oh, you want downstairs, 22A the basement. "
45,Graham Chapman," Ah! Thank you very much. Good morning. Come on 
            men, downstairs. "
46,John Cleese," Were you successful, Sir John? "
47,Graham Chapman, It's in the basement. 
48,John Cleese, In the basement? 
49,John Cleese, Eugh! 
50,Graham Chapman, Hello. 
51,Eric Idle, Ooooh. I think' it's someone about the damp. 
52,Graham Chapman, Hello. 
53,Michael Palin," Tell 'em about the bleeding rats, too. "
54,Eric Idle, I'll go 
55,Graham Chapman," Good morning, is this Lake Pahoe? "
56,Eric Idle," Well, I don't know about that, but it's bleeding 
            damp. Are you from the council? "
57,Graham Chapman," No. We are the official British Naval Expedition 
            to this lake. May we come in? "
58,Eric Idle, Hang on. 
59,Michael Palin, Bloody sharks. 
60,Eric Idle, Get in. 
61,Graham Chapman," Well um... that would appear to be the end of 
            the expedition."
0,John Cleese," The Magna Cana - was it a document signed at 
            Runnymede in 1215 by King John pledging independence to the English 
            barons, or was it a piece of chewing gum on a bedspread in Dorset? 
            The latter idea is the brainchild of a man new to the field of 
            historical research. Mr. Badger, why - why are you on this program?
            "
1,Eric Idle," Well, I think I can answer this question most 
            successfully in mime. "
2,John Cleese, But why Dorset? 
3,Eric Idle," Well, I have for a long time been suffering from a 
            species of brain injury which I incurred during the rigors of 
            childbirth, and I'd like to conclude by putting my finger up my 
            nose. "
4,John Cleese," Mr. Badger, I think you're the silliest 
            person we've ever had on this program, and so I'm going to ask you 
            to have dinner with me. "
5,Eric Idle," My wife Maureen ran off with a bottle of Bell's 
            whisky during the Aberdeen versus Raith Rovers match which ended in 
            a goalless draw. Robson particularly, in goal, had a magnificent 
            first half, his fine positional sense preventing the build-up of any 
            severe pressure on the suspect Aberdeen defense. McLoughlan missed 
            an easy chance to clinch the game towards the final whistle but 
            Raith must be well satisfied with their point. "
6,John Cleese," Do please go on. This is the least 
            fascinating conversation I've ever had. "
7,Michael Palin, Would you like to order sir? 
8,John Cleese," Yes, Mr. Badger, what .would you like to 
            start with? "
9,Eric Idle," Er, I'll have a whisky to start with. "
10,Michael Palin," For first course, sir? "
11,Eric Idle, Aye. 
12,Michael Palin," And for main course, sir? "
13,Eric Idle," I'll have a whisky for main course and I'll follow 
            that with a whisky for pudding. "
14,Michael Palin," Yes sir, and what would you like with it, sir? A 
            whisky? "
15,Eric Idle," No, a bottle of wine. "
16,Michael Palin," Fine, sir, he said between clenched teeth knowing 
            full well it was a most unrewarding part. "
17,John Cleese," This is the silliest sketch I've ever been 
            in. "
18,Eric Idle, Shall we stop it? 
19,John Cleese," Yeah, all right. "

3,Graham Chapman," Don't call me senõr! I'm not a Spanish person. 
            You must call me Mr. Biggles, or Group Captain Biggles: or Mary 
            Biggles if I'm dressed as my wife, but never senor. "
4,Nicki Howorth, Sorry. 
5,Graham Chapman, I've never even been to Spain. 
6,Nicki Howorth, You went to Ibiza last year. 
7,Graham Chapman," That's still not grounds for calling me senor, or 
            Don Beeg-les for that matter. Right, Dear King Haakon... "
8,Nicki Howorth," Of Norway, is that? "
9,Graham Chapman, Just put down what I say. 
10,Nicki Howorth, Do I put that down? 
11,Graham Chapman, Of course you don't put that down. 
12,Nicki Howorth, Well what about that? 
13,Graham Chapman, Look. 
14,Nicki Howorth, 
15,Graham Chapman, What? 
16,Nicki Howorth," Dear King Haakon, I am not dictating what? "
17,Graham Chapman," No, no, no, you loopy brothel inmate. "
18,Nicki Howorth," I've had enough of this. I am not a courtesan.
            "
19,Graham Chapman," Oh, oh, 'courtesan', oh aren't we grand. Harlot's 
            not good enough for us eh? Paramour, concubine, fille de joie. 
            That's what we are not. Well listen to me my fine fellow, you are a 
            bit of tail, that's what you are. "
20,Nicki Howorth," I am not, you demented fictional character. "
21,Graham Chapman," Algy says you are. He says you're no better than 
            you should be. "
22,Nicki Howorth, And how would he know? 
23,Graham Chapman," And just what do you mean by that? Are you 
            calling my old fictional comrade-in-arms a fairy? "
24,Nicki Howorth," Fairy! Poof's not good enough for Algy, is it. 
            He's got to be a bleedin' fairy. Mincing old RAF queen. "
25,Graham Chapman, 
26,Michael Palin, Right ho. 
27,Graham Chapman, Are you gay? 
28,Michael Palin," I should bally well say so, old fruit. "
29,Graham Chapman, Ugh!

            person. "
41,Graham Chapman, Lemon curry? 
42,Graham Chapman," Dear real Princess Margaret, thank you for the

            regal, full stop. Sorry to mench but if you've finished with the

            north face of the Uxbridge Road. "
1,Eric Idle," (voice over) The major assault on the Uxbridge Road 
            has been going on for about three weeks, really ever since they 
            established base camp here at the junction of Willesden Road, and 
            from there they climbed steadily to establish camp two, outside 
            Lewis's, and it's taken them another three days to establish camp 
            three, here outside the post office. "
2,John Cleese, Bert. How's it going? 
3,Graham Chapman," Well, it's a bit gripping is this, Chris. "
4,John Cleese," Bert, some people say this is crazy. "
5,Graham Chapman," Aye, well but they said Crippen was crazy didn't 
            they? "
6,John Cleese, Crippen was crazy. 
7,Graham Chapman," Oh, well there you are then. "
8,Michael Palin, Lemon curry? 
9,Graham Chapman," Now you see he's putting a peg down there because 
            I'm quite a way up now, and if I come unstuck here I go down quite a

4,Michael Palin," The deck, The deck of the lifeboat.
            "

            Parker Street. "
6,Michael Palin, This is the Newhaven Lifeboat.

8,Michael Palin," You're right. This isn't a lifeboat at 
            all. "
9,Terry Jones," No, I wouldn't live here if it was, "
10,Michael Palin," Do you mind if I sit down for a minute 
            and collect my wits? "
11,Terry Jones," No, you do that, I'll make you a nice cup of 
            tea. "
12,Michael Palin, Thanks very much. 
13,Graham Chapman," Oooh, it's a wild night up top. "
14,Terry Gilliam," Your turn on deck soon, Charlie. "
15,Michael Palin," It's not a lifeboat, Frank. "
16,Terry Gilliam, What?

5,Eric Idle," Hold on, Mrs. Pettigrew's coming back from the 
            doctor's. "
6,John Cleese," All right, bring her up on two. What's the 
            duration reading on the oscillator? "
7,Eric Idle, 48.47. 
8,John Cleese," Well that's a long time for someone who's just had 
            a routine checkup. "
9,Eric Idle, 
10,John Cleese," Zoom in on the 16mm and hold her, Enid. "
11,Eric Idle," Roger, Gladys. "
12,John Cleese, I'll try and get her on the twelve-inch. 
13,Michael Palin," Yes, it's one of those new 
            self-righting models. Newhaven was about the first place in the 
            country to get one. "
14,Graham Chapman," What's the displacement on one of them 
            jobs then? "
15,Michael Palin," Oh it's about I40-150 per square inch.

            and after this had happened and we had seen the titles of the show 
            we saw Biggles dictating a letter to his secretary who thought he 
            was Spanish and who he referred to as a 'harlot' and a 'woman of the 
            night' although she preferred to be called a 'courtesan'. Then we 
            saw some people trying to climb a road in Uxbridge and then there 
            were some cartoons and then some lifeboat men came into a woman's 
            sitting room and after a bit the woman went out to buy some cakes on 
            a lifeboat and then a naval officer jumped into the sea. Then we saw 
            a man telling us about storage jars from Bolivia and then there were 
            some more cartoons and then a man told us about what had happened on 
            the show so far and a great hammer came and hit him on the head. "
2,Michael Palin, Lemon Curry?
0,John Cleese, Good Morning.
1,Michael Palin," Good morning, Sir. Welcome to the National 
            Cheese Emporium!"
2,John Cleese," Ah, thank you, my good man."
3,Michael Palin," What can I do for you, Sir?"
4,John Cleese," Well, I was, uh, sitting in the public library 
            on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through ""Rogue Herrys"" by Hugh 
            Walpole, and I suddenly came over all peckish."
5,Michael Palin," Peckish, sir?"
6,John Cleese, Esuriant.
7,Michael Palin, Eh?
8,John Cleese," 'Ee, Ah wor 'ungry-loike!"
9,Michael Palin," Ah, hungry!"
10,John Cleese," In a nutshell. And I thought to myself, ""a 
            little fermented curd will do the trick,"" so, I curtailed my 
            Walpoling activities, sallied forth, and infiltrated your place of 
            purveyance to negotiate the vending of some cheesy comestibles!"
11,Michael Palin, Come again?
12,John Cleese, I want to buy some cheese.
13,Michael Palin," Oh, I thought you were complaining about the 
            bazouki player!"
14,John Cleese," Oh, heaven forbid: I am one who delights in all 
            manifestations of the Terpsichorean muse!"
15,Michael Palin, Sorry?
16,John Cleese," 'Ooo, Ah lahk a nice tuune, 'yer forced too!"
17,Michael Palin," So he can go on playing, can he?"
18,John Cleese," Most certainly! Now then, some cheese please, my 
            good man."
19,Michael Palin, 
20,John Cleese," Well, eh, how about a little red Leicester."
21,Michael Palin," I'm, afraid we're fresh out of red Leicester, 
            sir."
22,John Cleese," Oh, never mind, how are you on Tilsit?"
23,Michael Palin," I'm afraid we never have that at the end of 
            the week, sir, we get it fresh on Monday."
24,John Cleese," Tish tish. No matter. Well, stout yeoman, four 
            ounces of Caerphilly, if you please."
25,Michael Palin," Ah! It's beeeen on order, sir, for two weeks. 
            Was expecting it this morning."
26,John Cleese," 'T's Not my lucky day, is it? Aah, Bel Paese?"
27,Michael Palin," Sorry, sir."
28,John Cleese, Red Windsor?
29,Michael Palin," Normally, sir, yes. Today the van broke down."

52,John Cleese," Camenbert, perhaps?"
53,Michael Palin," Ah! We have Camenbert, yessir."
54,John Cleese, 
55,Michael Palin," Yessir. It's..ah,.....it's a bit runny..."
56,John Cleese," Oh, I like it runny."
57,Michael Palin," Well,.. It's very runny, actually, sir."
58,John Cleese," No matter. Fetch hither the fromage de la Belle 
            France! Mmmwah!"
59,Michael Palin," I...think it's a bit runnier than you'll like 
            it, sir."
60,John Cleese," I don't care how fucking runny it is. Hand it 
            over with all speed."
61,Michael Palin," Oooooooooohhh........!
            "

76,John Cleese," You...do *have* some cheese, don't you?"
77,Michael Palin, 
78,John Cleese, No no... don't tell me. I'm keen to guess.
79,Michael Palin, Fair enough.
80,John Cleese," Uuuuuh, Wenslydale."
81,Michael Palin, Yes?
82,John Cleese," Ah, well, I'll have some of that!"
83,Michael Palin," Oh! I thought you were talking to me, sir. 
            Mister Wenslydale, that's my name."

98,John Cleese, Venezuelan Beaver Cheese?
99,Michael Palin," Not *today*, sir, no."
100,John Cleese," Aah, how about Cheddar?"
101,Michael Palin," Well, we don't get much call for it around 
            here, sir."
102,John Cleese," Not much ca--It's the single most popular cheese 
            in the world!"
103,Michael Palin," Not 'round here, sir."
104,John Cleese,"
"
105,Michael Palin," 'Illchester, sir."
106,John Cleese, IS it.
107,Michael Palin," Oh, yes, it's staggeringly popular in this 
            manor, squire."
108,John Cleese, Is it.
109,Michael Palin," It's our number one best seller, sir!"
110,John Cleese," I see. Uuh...'Illchester, eh?"
111,Michael Palin," Right, sir."
112,John Cleese," All right. Okay. 'Have you got any?' he asked, 
            expecting the answer 'no'."
113,Michael Palin," I'll have a look, sir... nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno."
114,John Cleese," It's not much of a cheese shop, is it?"
115,Michael Palin, Finest in the district!
116,John Cleese, 
117,Michael Palin," Well, it's so clean, sir!"
118,John Cleese, It's certainly uncontaminated by cheese....
119,Michael Palin, 
120,John Cleese, Would it be worth it?
121,Michael Palin, Could be....
122,John Cleese, Have you --SHUT THAT BLOODY BAZOUKI OFF!
123,Michael Palin, Told you sir....
124,John Cleese, 
125,Michael Palin, No.
126,John Cleese," Figures. Predictable, really I suppose. It was 
            an act of purest optimism to have posed the question in the first 
            place. Tell me"
127,Michael Palin, Yessir?
128,John Cleese, Have you in fact got any cheese here at all.
129,Michael Palin, Yessir.
130,John Cleese, Really?
131,Michael Palin," No. Not really, sir."
132,John Cleese, You haven't.
133,Michael Palin," No sir. Not a scrap. I was deliberately 
            wasting your time, sir."
134,John Cleese," Well I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to shoot 
            you."
135,Michael Palin," Right-o, sir."
136,John Cleese, What a *senseless* waste of human life.

0,Michael Palin, Hello everybody. 
1,Michael Palin, I say what a simply super day. 
2,Carol Cleveland," It's so, you know, sunny. "
3,Michael Palin, Yes isn't it? I say anyone for tennis? 
4,Graham Chapman, Oh super!

0,Michael Palin," August 18th. Fell off near Bovey 
            Tracey. The pump caught in my trouser leg, and my sandwiches were 
            badly crushed. "
1,Michael Palin," The pump caught in my trouser leg, and my 
            sandwiches were badly crushed."
2,Eric Idle, 35p. (He goes back to working the machine).
3,Michael Palin," These sandwiches, however, were an excellent 
            substitute."
4,John Cleese," Give us ten woods, Barney."
5,Michael Palin, Hello!
6,Michael Palin," It's funny how one can go through life, as I have, 
            disliking bananas and being indifferent to cheese, and then be able 
            to eat, and enjoy, a banana and cheese sandwich like that."
7,Eric Idle, 35p please. (A juke box starts up in the background)
8,Michael Palin, Ah! I have only a 50. Do you have change?
9,Eric Idle, 
10,Michael Palin, I'm most awfully sorry.
11,Eric Idle, 15p.
12,Michael Palin," Oh, that was lucky. Well, all the very best. "
13,Michael Palin," August 23rd. Fell off near Budleigh 
            Salterton."
14,Michael Palin, ...and the pump caught in my trouser leg.
15,Michael Palin, And that's why they were damaged...
16,Michael Palin, 
17,Michael Palin," Aug. 26th. Fell off near Ottery St. Mary. 
            The pump caught in my trouser leg. Decide to wear short trousers 
            from now on."
18,Michael Palin," Fell off near Tiverton. Perhaps a shorter 
            pump is the answer."
19,Michael Palin," Excuse me, madam, can you tell me of a good 
            bicycle shop in this village, where I could find either some means 
            of adapting my present pump, or, failing that, purchase a 
            replacement?"
20,Eric Idle, There's only one shop here.
21,Michael Palin," What a stroke of luck. Now perhaps cycling will 
            become less precarious."
22,Eric Idle, Yes?
23,Graham Chapman," (sticking her head around the door): There's a Mr. 
            Pither to see you, Doctor. His bicycle pump got caught in his sock."
24,Eric Idle," Alright, nurse, send him in."
25,Eric Idle, Morning.
26,Michael Palin," A very good morning to you too, Doctor"
27,Eric Idle, I gather you had an accident?
28,Michael Palin," Yes, my pump got..."
29,Eric Idle, ...caught in your sock.
30,Michael Palin," Yes, and my fruit cake was damaged on one side."
31,Eric Idle, Well...
32,Michael Palin, It's got grit all over it.
33,Eric Idle," Well now, are you in pain? "
34,Michael Palin, Oh heavens no.
35,Eric Idle, Well where were you hurt?
36,Michael Palin, I escaped without injury fortunately. 
37,Eric Idle, Well what is the trouble?
38,Michael Palin, Could you tell me the way to Iddesley?
39,Eric Idle," I'm a doctor, you know."
40,Michael Palin," Oh yes. Under normal circumstances I would have 
            asked a policeman or a minister of the Church, but finding no one 
            available, I thought it better to consult a man with some 
            qualifications, rather than rely on the possibly confused testimony 
            of a passer-by."
41,Eric Idle, Oh alright. 
42,Michael Palin, Thank you.
43,Michael Palin," Sept 2nd. Did not fall off outside 
            Iddesley."
44,Michael Palin, Fell off in Tavistock.
45,Michael Palin," My leg got caught in my trousers and that's how 
            the bottle broke."
46,Carol Cleveland," Tell her today, you could ring her."
47,John Cleese, I can't. I can't.
48,Michael Palin, I said you'd never guess.
49,John Cleese," 16 years we've been together. I can't just ring her 
            up."
50,Carol Cleveland," If you can't do it now, you never will."
51,Michael Palin, Do you like Tizer?
52,John Cleese, 
53,Carol Cleveland," Do you want me or not? It's your decision, James."
54,Michael Palin, I suppose it is still available in this area?
55,Carol Cleveland," Do you want me or not, James?"
56,John Cleese, What?
57,Michael Palin, Tizer.
58,Carol Cleveland, Yes or no.
59,Michael Palin, Is it still available in this area?
60,John Cleese, 
61,Carol Cleveland," In that case it's goodbye for ever, James."
62,John Cleese, No! I mean yes!
63,Michael Palin, Oh it is?
64,John Cleese, 
65,Carol Cleveland, You never *could* make up your mind.
66,John Cleese, I can.... I have....
67,Carol Cleveland, 
68,John Cleese," No wait, Lucille!"
69,Michael Palin, And does your lovely daughter like Tizer?
70,John Cleese, Lucille!
71,Michael Palin," I wouldn't mind buying *her* a bottle of Tizer.... 
            if it's available in this area, that is."
72,John Cleese, 
73,Michael Palin," Well that's extremely thoughtful of you, but I saw 
            it on the way in."
74,John Cleese," You stupid, interfering little rat."
75,Michael Palin, Oh! The very words of the garage mechanic in Bude!
76,Michael Palin," I had just fallen off...and my cheese tartlet had 
            become embedded in the..."
77,John Cleese," Damn your cheese tartlet! And damn you, sir!"
78,Michael Palin," ...dynamo hub... which was not at that time 
            functioning..."
79,Michael Palin, Just had a chat with your dad.
80,Michael Palin," Yes...my rubber instep caught on the rear 
            mud-guard stanchion and..."
81,Terry Jones," Really? And what happened to your corned beef 
            rolls?"
82,Michael Palin," They were squashed out of all recog... here just a 
            minute. How did you know about the corned beef rolls?"
83,Terry Jones," I saw them - or what remained of them - on the 
            road. I noticed also that the lemon curd tart had sustained some 
            superficial damage."
84,Michael Palin, The curd had become...
85,Terry Jones, Detached from the pastry base.
86,Michael Palin, 
87,Terry Jones," Otherwise the contents of the sandwich box were 
            relatively unharmed, though I detected small particles of bitumen in 
            the chocolate cup cakes."
88,Michael Palin, But they were wrapped in foil!
89,Terry Jones," Not the hard chocolate top, I'm afraid."
90,Michael Palin," Oh dear, that's the bit I liked."
91,Terry Jones," The ginger biscuit, the crisps and the sausage 
            roll were unharmed."
92,Michael Palin, How do you know so much about cycling?
93,Terry Jones," I'm making a special study of accidents 
            involving food."
94,Michael Palin, Really?
95,Terry Jones," Do you know that in our laboratories we have 
            produced a cheese sandwich that can withstand an impact of 4,000 lbs 
            per square inch?"
96,Michael Palin, Good heavens!
97,Terry Jones," Amazing, isn't it? We have also developed a 
            tomato which ejects itself when an accident is imminent."
98,Michael Palin, Even if it's inside am egg and tomato roll?
99,Terry Jones," Anywhere! Even if it's in your stomach, and it 
            senses an accident it will come up your throat and out of the 
            window. Do you realize what this means?"
100,Michael Palin, Safer food?
101,Terry Jones," Exactly! No longer will food be damaged, crushed 
            or squashed by the ignorance and stupidity of the driver! "
102,Michael Palin, Er....
103,Terry Jones," Yes, of course it has! But there are other 
            things that haven't!.... the safety straps for sardines for 
            instance."
104,Michael Palin, That tomato just ejected itself.
105,Terry Jones, Really?
106,Michael Palin, Yes.
107,Terry Jones, 
108,Michael Palin," What a strange turn this cycling tour has 
            taken. Mr. Gulliver appears to have lost his memory and far from 
            being interested in safer food is now convinced that he is Clodagh 
            Rogers the young girl singer. I am taking him for medical attention."
109,Michael Palin, Good afternoon... is this the Casualty Department?
110,Graham Chapman," Yes, that's right."
111,Graham Chapman, What can I do for you?
112,Michael Palin," Well, I am at present on a cycling tour of the 
            North Cornwall area taking in Bude and..."
113,Graham Chapman, Could I have your name please?
114,Michael Palin, My name is Pither.
115,Graham Chapman, Hm?
116,Michael Palin," No... P I T H E R ... as in Brotherhood, but with 
            PI instead of the BRO and no HOOD."
117,Graham Chapman, I see...
118,Michael Palin, I had already visited Taunton...
119,Graham Chapman, Sh!
120,Michael Palin, ...and was cycling north in...
121,Graham Chapman, Where were you injured?
122,Michael Palin, Just where the A397 Ilfracombe road meets the...
123,Graham Chapman, No - on your body...
124,Michael Palin," Ah no... it's not I who was injured, it's my 
            friend."
125,Graham Chapman, Tut... Name?
126,Michael Palin, Pither.
127,Graham Chapman, 
128,Michael Palin, Clodagh Rogers...
129,Graham Chapman, Clodagh Rogers!
130,Michael Palin, Well...since about 4:30....
131,Graham Chapman," ...well I think you ought to tell Doctor Wu... 
            Doctor!"
132,Eric Idle, What? Damn!
133,Graham Chapman, Aaaaaagh!
134,Eric Idle," Now, what's the trouble?"
135,Michael Palin, I am on a cycling tour of...
136,Graham Chapman, 
137,Michael Palin," Yes, I have friend who, as a result of his 
            injuries, has become Clodagh Rogers."
138,Eric Idle," Don't be silly, man; people don't just become 
            Clodagh Rogers."
139,Michael Palin," So you may think, but what happened in this case 
            was..."
140,Terry Jones, 
141,Eric Idle, Aaaaagh!
142,Michael Palin," Sept 4th. Well I never. We are now in the 
            Alpes Maritimes region of Southern France. Clodagh seems more intent 
            on reaching Moscow than on rehearsing her new BBC1 series with Buddy 
            Rich and the Younger Generation."
143,Michael Palin, Hallo!
144,Terry Jones," We cannot stay here. We must leave immediately. 
            There is a ship at Marseilles."
145,Michael Palin," I did enjoy your song for Europe, Clodagh."
146,Terry Jones," I have seen an agent in the town. My life is in 
            danger."
147,Michael Palin," Danger, Clodagh?"
148,Terry Jones, Stalin has always hated me.
149,Michael Palin," No one hates you, Clodagh."
150,Terry Jones," I will not let myself fall into the hands of 
            these scum."
151,Michael Palin," I suggest you have a little lie down, my dear. 
            There is a busy day of concerts and promotional visits tomorrow."
152,Terry Jones," I. One of the founders of the greatest nation on 
            earth. I! Who Lenin called his greatest friend."
153,John Cleese, Taissez-vous. Taissez-vous.
154,Michael Palin, Oh dear.
155,Terry Jones," I! who have fought and suffered that our people 
            should live."
156,John Cleese," Taissez-vous. Qu'est-ce que le bruit? C'est 
            impossible."
157,Michael Palin, Er... my name is Pither.
158,John Cleese, Oh... you are English?
159,Michael Palin," Er yes. I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall, 
            taking in Bude."
160,Terry Jones," I will not be defeated. I will return to my land 
            and continue the fight against this new tyranny."
161,Michael Palin," This is Clodagh Rogers, the Irish-born girl 
            singer."
162,Eric Idle, Mais oui 
163,Terry Jones, They will never silence me. They will nev...
164,John Cleese," Excusez-moi Mam'selle Clodagh. Ecrivez vous votre 
            nom dans mon livre des celebrites. "
165,Eric Idle, Quoi?
166,John Cleese, C'est Trotsky le revolutionaire.
167,John Cleese, Trotsky!
168,Eric Idle, Trotsky ne chante pas.
169,John Cleese, Un peu.
170,Eric Idle, Mais pas professionalement. Tu penses de Lenin.
171,John Cleese, Lenin!! Quel chanteur: 'If I ruled the world'.
172,Terry Jones, Lenin. My friend. I come. 
173,Michael Palin, 
174,John Cleese, 
175,Eric Idle, Formidable.
176,Michael Palin," After several days I succeeded in tracking 
            down my friend Mr. Gulliver to the outskirts of Smolensk."
177,Eric Idle," Smolensk. 200 miles west of Minsk. 200 north 
            of Kursk. 1500 miles west of Omsk."
178,Michael Palin, Thank you.
179,Michael Palin," Anyway, as we were so far from home, and as 
            Mr. Gulliver, still believing himself to be Trotsky, was very tired 
            from haranguing the masses all the way from Monte Carlo,"
180,Eric Idle," Monte Carlo. 100 miles south of Turin. 100 
            west of Pisa. 500 miles east of Bilbao."
181,Michael Palin, Thank you. I decided to check...
182,Michael Palin, I decided to check...
183,Michael Palin," No, you go on."
184,Michael Palin," I decided to check him into a hotel while I 
            visited the British Embassy to ask for help in returning to 
            Cornwall."
185,Michael Palin," And so we registered at the Smolensk Young 
            Men's Anti-Christian Association."
186,Eric Idle," Y.M.C.A. Corner of Anti-Semitic street and 
            Pogrom square."
187,Michael Palin, 
188,Terry Gilliam," Yes, sir. Bugged or unbugged?"
189,Terry Jones, 
190,Terry Gilliam, One bugged with bath.
191,Michael Palin," Have a nice lie down. I'm just off to the Embassy.
            "
192,Terry Gilliam," Trotsky! My lack of God, it's Trotsky!"
193,Terry Jones," Comrades. Socialism is not a national doctrine 
            it... "
194,Michael Palin, Excuse me. Is this the British Consulate?
195,John Cleese," Yes yes... si si... That is correctment. Yes... 
            Piccadilly Circus, mini-skirt... Joe Lyons."
196,Michael Palin," I wish to see the Consul, please."
197,John Cleese," That's right. Speakee speakee... me Blitish 
            consul."
198,Michael Palin, Oh! 
199,John Cleese," No. He died. He have heart attack and fell out 
            of window onto exploding bomb, and was run over in shooting 
            accident. Nasty business. I his susscussor... how you say... 
            succsussor."
200,Michael Palin, Successor.
201,John Cleese," Successor yes... I his successor, Mr. Atkinson."
202,Michael Palin," Oh, I see."
203,Michael Palin, Well.... a *drink* would be extremely pleasant.
204,Michael Palin," I'm a West Country man myself, Mr. Atkinson."
205,Michael Palin, No - West of England... Cornwall.
206,John Cleese, 
207,Michael Palin, Cornwall.
208,Michael Palin, Rather. 
209,Michael Palin, Pither.

211,Michael Palin, Oh... Bingo...
212,John Cleese, 
213,Michael Palin, Well it's not quite my line...
214,Michael Palin, Well...
215,Michael Palin," Well, Mr. Atkinson, I was hoping that you could 
            help me and my friend to get back to England as..."
216,Michael Palin, I'm actually cycling to...
217,John Cleese, Star Bingo! 
218,Graham Chapman, Bingo... Top Rank... ahhhh!
219,Michael Palin, Well I think I'll be off...
220,Graham Chapman, Bingo etc. etc.
221,Michael Palin, Is Mr. Trotsky in his room please?
222,Terry Gilliam, No. He has gone to Moscow.
223,Eric Idle, Moscow. 1500 miles due East of...
224,Terry Gilliam, Shut up!
225,Michael Palin, Moscow!
226,Eric Idle, Come with us please.
227,Michael Palin, Who're you?
228,John Cleese, Well we're not secret police anyway.
229,Graham Chapman, That's for sure.
230,Eric Idle," If anything we are ordinary Soviet systems with no 
            particular interest in politics."
231,John Cleese, None at all. Come with us.
232,Michael Palin, Where are you taking me?
233,Graham Chapman, What do we tell him?
234,Eric Idle, Don't tell him any secrets.
235,John Cleese, Agreed.
236,Eric Idle," Tell him anything except that we are taking him to 
            Moscow to be present as an Honored Guest when Trotsky is reunited 
            with the Central Committee."
237,Graham Chapman, We're taking you to a Clam Bake.
238,Michael Palin, Oh a Clam Bake. I've never been to one of them.
239,Eric Idle," Right, let's go."
240,John Cleese, Who's giving the orders round here?
241,Eric Idle, I am. I'm senior to you.
242,John Cleese," No, you're not. You're a greengrocer, I'm an 
            insurance salesman."
243,Eric Idle, Greengrocers are senior to insurance salesman.
244,John Cleese, No they're not! 
245,Graham Chapman," Cool it. I'm an ice-cream salesman and I am senior 
            to both of you. "
246,John Cleese," You're an ice-cream salesman? I thought you were a 
            veterinarian. "
247,Graham Chapman, I got promoted. Let's go. 
248,John Cleese, Taxi! 
249,Carol Cleveland, Yes. 
250,John Cleese, Drive us to Moscow. 
251,Carol Cleveland, I have no cab. 
252,Graham Chapman, Why not? 
253,Carol Cleveland, I'm in the secret police.

257,John Cleese," And now, Comrades, the greatest moment of a great 
            day, the moment when I ask you to welcome the return of one of 
            Russia's greatest heroes, creator of the Red Army, Lenin's greatest 
            friend, Lev Davidovich Trotsky! "
258,Terry Jones," Comrades. Bolsheviks. Friends of the Revolution. 
            I have returned. "
259,Michael Palin, 
260,John Cleese, 
261,John Cleese, Shall I seize him too? 
262,Graham Chapman," No, I think we'll have to keep him, he's 
            going down well. "
263,John Cleese, He's more fun than he used to be. 
264,Graham Chapman," He's loosened up a lot. This is an old 
            Lenin number. "
265,Michael Palin, 
266,Michael Palin, 
267,John Cleese, Cigarettes? 
268,Michael Palin," Oh, no thank you I don't smoke. "
269,Michael Palin,

274,John Cleese, A telegram? 
275,Michael Palin, 
276,John Cleese, 
277,John Cleese, Shut up! Go and practice. 
278,Michael Palin, 
279,John Cleese," Next time, definitely! "
280,Michael Palin, 
281,Eric Idle," Come on, dear, wake up, dear. "
282,Michael Palin, Mother! 
283,Eric Idle," Come on, dear. "
284,Michael Palin," So, it was all a dream. "
285,Eric Idle," No dear, this is the dream, you're still in the 
            cell. "
286,John Cleese," OK, we're going to have another try. I think 
            we've got it now. My boys. have been looking down the wrong bit, you 
            see. "
287,Michael Palin," Oh no, look, you've got to look down the bit 
            there. "
288,John Cleese, I thought you had to look down that bit. 
289,Michael Palin," No, no, you've got to look down that bit, or you 
            won't hit anything. "
290,John Cleese," All right,. we'll give it a whirl. Guards, seize 
            him. "
291,John Cleese, 
292,Eric Idle, Osledi. Osledi.

297,Michael Palin, Here! 
298,Michael Palin, Gulliver. 
299,Terry Jones, Pither! What a stroke of luck. 
300,Michael Palin, Well yes and no. 
301,Michael Palin," Phew, what an amazing escape. Well goodbye, 
            Reginald. "
302,Terry Jones," Goodbye, Mr. Pither, and good luck with, the 
            tour! "
0,Michael Palin," This is Captain MacPherson welcoming you 
            aboard East Scottish Airways. You'll have had your tea. Our 
            destination is Glasgow. There is no need to panic. "
1,Eric Idle," There's bomb on board this plane, and I'll tell 
            you where it is for a thousand pounds. "
2,John Cleese, I don't believe you. 
3,Eric Idle," If you don't tell me where the bomb is... if I 
            don't give you the money... Unless you give me the bomb... "
4,Carol Cleveland, The money. 
5,Eric Idle," The money, thank you, pretty lady... the bomb will 
            explode killing everybody. "
6,John Cleese, Including you. 
7,Eric Idle, I'll tell you where it is for a pound. 
8,John Cleese, Here's a pound. 
9,Eric Idle," I don't want Scottish money. They've got the 
            numbers. It can be traced. "
10,John Cleese, One English pound. Now where's the bomb? 
11,Eric Idle, I can't remember. 
12,John Cleese, You've forgotten. 
13,Eric Idle," Ay, you'd better have your pound back. Oh... "
14,Michael Palin, Now where's the bomb? 
15,Eric Idle," Ah, wait a tic, wait a tic. "
16,John Cleese, It's in the luggage compartment. 
17,Eric Idle, Right. Here's your pound.. 
18,Graham Chapman, This character giving you any trouble? 
19,Michael Palin, He's ruined this sketch. 
20,John Cleese, Absolutely. 
21,Graham Chapman, Let's go on to the next one. 
22,Eric Idle," 'Wait a tic, wait a tic. No. I won't ruin your 
            sketch for a pound. "
23,John Cleese," No, no. "
24,Eric Idle, 75P. 
25,Graham Chapman, Next item. 
0,Terry Jones," Well I see my role in it as, er, how can I put 
            it best - the nude man - as sort of symbolizing the two separate 
            strands of existence, the essential nudity of man... "
1,John Cleese," It's an interesting question. Personally I 
            rather adhere to the Bergsonian idea of laughter as a social 
            sanction against inflexible behavior but... excuse me a moment... 
            And now... "

3,Eric Idle, 
0,Michael Palin," This new housing development in Bristol is one 
            of the most interesting in the country. It's using a variety of new 
            techniques: shock-proof curtain-walling, a central high voltage, 
            self-generated electricity source, and extruded acrylic fiberglass 
            fitments. It's also the first major housing project in Britain to be 
            built entirely by characters from nineteenth-century English 
            literature. "
1,Michael Palin," Here Little Nell, from Dickens's 'Old 
            Curiosity Shop' fits new nylon syphons into the asbestos-lined 
            ceilings ... "
2,Eric Idle," Because sir, it is self-generating. Because we 
            have harnessed here in this box the very forces of life itself. The 
            very forces that will send Helen running back to beg forgiveness!
            "
3,Michael Palin," The on-site building techniques involve the 
            construction of twelve-foot walling blocks by a crowd of farmhands 
            from 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles' supervised by the genial landlady, 
            Mrs. Jupp, from Samuel Butler's 'Way of All Flesh'. "
0,Eric Idle," In contrast to the site in Bristol, it's 
            progress here on Britain's first eighteen-level motorway interchange 
            being built by characters from Milton's 'Paradise Lost'... "
1,Eric Idle, 
2,Terry Jones," Well, no one really got on. Satan didn't get on 
            with Eve ... er... Archangel Gabriel didn't get on with Satan... 
            nobody got on with the Serpent, so now they have to work a rota: 
            forces of good from ten till three, forces of evil three to six. "
3,Michael Palin," But even more modern building techniques are 
            being used on an expanding new town site near Peterborough; here the 
            Amazing Mystico and Janet can put up a block of flats by hypnosis in 
            under a minute."
0,Michael Palin," (MICHAEL) Well there is a considerable 
            financial advantage in using the services of El Mystico. A block, 
            like Mystico Point here, "
1,Graham Chapman," Of course they're safe. There's absolutely no 
            doubt about that. They are as ,strong, solid and as safe as any 
            other building method in this country provided of course people 
            believe in them. "
2,Eric Idle," Yes, we received a note from the Council saying 
            that if we ceased to believe in this building it would fall down.
            "
3,Eric Idle," No, it's much better than where we used to live.
            "
4,Eric Idle," We had an eighteen-roomed villa overlooking Nice.
            "
5,Eric Idle, Oh yes - yes you're right. 
6,Eric Idle," No, no, no, of course not. "
7,Eric Idle," Phew, that was close. "

1,John Cleese, Turn that radio off and look lively!

3,John Cleese," Don't argue, Battersby. "
4,Graham Chapman," ... This is our mortuary in here, Your Grace ...
            "
5,Michael Palin," I say, I say, I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... er ... 
            I ... I can't think of anything to say about it. "
6,Graham Chapman," Well, we're very proud of it here, sir. It's one of 
            the most up to date in the country. "
7,Michael Palin," I see... yes... yes ... now... um... what... what... 
            ah... ah... what is it? .... it a power station? "
8,Graham Chapman," No, Your Grace, it's a mortuary. "
9,Michael Palin," I see ... I see ... good ... good ... good, good, 
            good... "
10,Graham Chapman," But it has one of the most advanced thermostat 
            control systems in the country, and it has computer-controlled 
            storage facilities. "
11,Michael Palin," I see, I see ... I ... er... er... er... er ... I 
            ... er ... I'm a good little doggie. "
12,Graham Chapman," I'm sorry, Your Grace? "
13,Michael Palin, I'm a good little dog. 
14,Carol Cleveland, Oh dear... 
15,Graham Chapman, Perhaps we should postpone the visit? 
16,Carol Cleveland," No, no, no - you see it's just that his brain 
            is so tiny that the slightest movement can dislodge it "
17,Michael Palin," Ah! Now then, excellent, excellent, excellent, 
            excellent. Now then ... ah ... what happens when the steel is poured 
            into the ingots? "
18,Graham Chapman, 
19,Michael Palin," Yes... yes ... yes ... yes... yes rather jolly 
            good... jolly good .. jolly good ... jolly good ... no fear... "
20,John Cleese," Well the answers were as follows: 1) the left 
            hand, 2) no, 3) normal, 4) yes it has, in I963 when a bird got 
            caught in the mechanism. How did you get on? "
21,John Cleese, Turn that thing off! 
22,Terry Jones," Oh! It's 'Mortuary Dance Time', Mr. Wang! "
23,John Cleese," Never mind that, Battersby, this is the big one. 
            I've just had Whitby Police on the phone with twelve hangees... "
24,Terry Jones," Oh yes, I just heard about that on the radios 
            ... "
25,John Cleese," No, these are twelve different ones ... so shtoom.

            moments from now, and there you can see the two competitors 
            Francisco Huron the Paraguayan, who in this leg is the seeker "

            Remember the Paraguayan has got 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 
            hours... "

5,Michael Palin," Well, we'll be taking you back there as soon 
            as there are any developments. "
6,Michael Palin," We've just heard that something is happening 
            in the Hide-and-Seek final, so let's go straight over there. "
7,Eric Idle," Hello again, and welcome to Madagascar, where 
            Francisco Huron is seeking Don Roberts. And I've just been told that 
            he has been told that he has been unofficially described as 'cold'. 
            Ah, wait a minute. "
8,Michael Palin, Really beginning to hot up now. 
9,Eric Idle," So here we are on the very last day of this 
            fantastic final. Huron now has less than twelve hours left to find 
            British ace Don Roberts. Early this morning he finished combing the 
            outskirts of Lisbon and now he seems to have staked everything on 
            one final desperate seek here in the Tagus valley. But Roberts is 
            over fifteen hundred miles away, and it's beginning to look all 
            over, bar the shouting. The sands of time are running out for this 
            delving dago, this senior of seek, perspicacious Paraguayan. He's 
            still desperately cold and it's beginning to look like another gold 
            for Britain. "
10,Michael Palin," The official result of the World Hide-and-Seek, 
            Mr. Don Roberrs from Hinckley, Leicestershire, 11 years, 2 months, 
            26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27 seconds. Mr. Francisco Huron, 
            Paraguay, 11 years, a months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27 
            seconds. The result - a tie. "
11,John Cleese," A tie! Well what a fantastic result. Well the 
            replay will start tomorrow at 7.30 a.m. "
12,Michael Palin," Well hello again .... nice to be back ... glad to 
            see the series has been doing well. Well now, sorry about Monterrey.
            "
13,Michael Palin," That was a little item entitled Hide-and-Seek - 
            very anarchic, very effective, not quite my cup of tea, but very 
            nice for the younger people. Well, the next item the boys have put 
            together takes place in a sitting room. Sorry it's just a sitting 
            room, but the bank account's a bit low after the appallingly 
            expensive production of 'Clothmerle'... "
0,John Cleese," Sorry about that, darling... "
1,Carol Cleveland, Gravy? 
2,John Cleese," Yes please, dear. "
3,Carol Cleveland," Oh dear, that'll be the Cheap-Laughs from 
            next door. "
4,John Cleese, Come in. 
5,Terry Jones, No! Just breathing heavily! 
6,Graham Chapman, Oh we just dropped in. 
7,John Cleese, Would you like to come through... 
8,Terry Jones, Well goodnight and give us a kiss. 
9,Graham Chapman," Oh thank you very much for a very nice 
            evening. "
10,Terry Jones," After you, dear. "
11,Carol Cleveland," Oh honestly dear, why do we always have to 
            buy everything just because the Cheap-Laughs have one? "
12,John Cleese," It's just neighborliness dear, that's all...
            "
13,Carol Cleveland," I think we should try and lead our own 
            lives from now on. "
14,John Cleese, Can't you be serious for one moment? 
15,John Cleese, I'm sorry I was cross earlier. 
16,Carol Cleveland," Oh that's all right, dear. It's just that 
            I. get so sick of always having to be like the Cheap-Laughs. "
17,John Cleese," Well yes, from now on we'll be like 
            ourselves. "
18,Carol Cleveland, Oh Roger... 
19,John Cleese, Oh Beatrice. 
0,Eric Idle," Many people in this country are becoming 
            increasingly worried about bull-fighting. They say it's not only 
            cruel, vicious and immoral, but also blatantly unfair. The bull is 
            heavy, violent, abusive and aggressive with four legs and great 
            sharp teeth, whereas the bull-fighter is only a small, greasy 
            Spaniard. Given this basic inequality what can be done to make 
            bull-fighting safer? We asked Brigadier Arthur Farquar-Smith, 
            Chairman of the British Well-Basically Club. "
1,John Cleese," Well, basically it's quite apparent that these 
            little dago chappies have got it all wrong. They prance round the 
            bull like a lot of bally night club dancers looking like the Younger 
            Generation or a less smooth version of the Lionel Blair Troupe, "
0,John Cleese," This is the planet Algon, fifth world in the

            million pounds, an immersion heater for the hot-water tank costs 
            over six billion pounds. and a pair of split-crotch panties would be 
            almost unobtainable. "
1,Michael Palin," Well, our computers have been working all day to 
            analyze the dramatic information that's come in from this first ever 
            intergalactic probe, Algon... I ... "
2,Terry Jones, 
3,Michael Palin," Of course the big question that everyone's asking 
            here is, what about those split-crotch parities? Are they going to 
            be unobtainable throughout the Universe or merely on Algon itself?. 
            Professor? "
4,Eric Idle," We must remember that Algon is over 75,000 
            miles wide. The probes come down to this area here and we're really 
            only getting signals from a radius of only thirty or forty miles 
            around the probe. Split-crotch panties, or indeed any items of what 
            we scientists call, 'Sexy Underwear' or 'Erotic Lingerie' may be 
            much more plentiful on other parts of the planet. "
5,Michael Palin," Professor, you were responsible for finding 
            Scanty-Panties and Golden Goddess High-Lift Bras on planets which 
            were never thought able to sustain life, and now that man has 
            discovered a new galaxy do you think we're going to see underwear 
            become even naughtier? "
6,Eric Idle, Oh naughtier and naughtier. 
7,Michael Palin," Well so much for that ... But of course, the 
            probe itself has excited a great deal of interest... for it contains 
            uranium-based dual transmission cells entirely re-charged by solar 
            radiation, which can take off a bra and panties in less than fifteen 
            seconds. It is, of course, the first piece of space hardware to be 
            specially designed to undress ladies, and so there are bound to be 
            some teething troubles ... such as how to cope with the combination 
            of elastic-sided boots and tights. "
8,Michael Palin," But I think we're getting some pictures now from 
            Algon itself, and it looks as though ... yes! The satellite has 
            found a bird! The probe has struck crumpet and she looks pretty good 
            too! Professor? "
9,Eric Idle, Ja - she's a. real honey! 
10,Michael Palin," Well the pictures are a bit sporadic... I think 
            probably... the solar radiation during the long journey to Algon...
            "
0,Terry Jones," Morning, sir, can I help you? "
1,Graham Chapman," Yes, yes... I wondered if you have any part-time 
            vacancies on your books.. "
2,Terry Jones," Part-time, I'll have a look, sir. "
3,Graham Chapman," I see. Have you anything a bit more modern, you 
            know, like a job on the buses, or digging the underground? "
4,Terry Jones," Oh no, we only have Tudor jobs. "
5,Graham Chapman," That can't be very profitable, can it? "
6,Terry Jones," Well, you'd be surprised, actually sir. The 
            Tudor economy's booming, ever since Sir Humphrey Gilbert opened up 
            the North- west passage to Cathay, and the Cabots' expansion in 
            Canada, there's been a tremendous surge in exports, and trade with 
            the Holy Roman Empire is going... no, quite right, it's no good at 
            all. "
7,Graham Chapman, What? 
8,Terry Jones," It's a dead loss. We haven't put anyone in a 
            job since 1625. "
9,Graham Chapman, I see. 
10,Terry Jones, That's all? 
11,Graham Chapman, What? 
12,Terry Jones, That's all you say? 
13,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
14,Terry Jones," No, no, we were the tops then. Drake got all 
            his sailors here. Elizabeth, we supplied the archbishops for her 
            coronation. Shakespeare started off from here as a temp. Then came 
            James the First and the bottom fell out of the Tudor jobs. 1603 - 
            800 vacancies filled, 1604 - 40, 1605 - none, 1606 - none. The rest 
            of the Stuart period nothing. Hanoverions nothing. Victorians 
            nothing. Saxe-Coburgs nothing. Windsors... what did you want? "
15,Graham Chapman," Dirty books, please. "
16,Terry Jones, Right. 
17,Graham Chapman, Have you got anything a bit... er... 
18,Terry Jones, A bit stronger? 
19,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
20,Terry Jones, Hold on ... a... My Lord of Warwick! 
21,Eric Idle, 
22,Terry Jones," Raise high the drawbridge. Gloucester's troops 
            approach. "
23,Eric Idle, 
24,Terry Jones," Can't be too careful you know, sir. "
0,Eric Idle," There's a 'Bridget - Queen of the Whip'.
            "
1,John Cleese," Yes.., "
2,Eric Idle," Or 'Naughty Nora'... or there's this 
            one: 'Doug, Bob and Gordon Visit the Ark Royal'. Or there's 'Sister 
            Teresa - The Spanking Nun'. "
3,John Cleese," Mmmm... I see ... you don't have anything specially 
            about Devon and Cornwall? "
4,Eric Idle," No. I'm afraid not, sir. "
5,John Cleese," The one I was really after was Arthur Hotchkiss's 
            'Devonshire Country Churches'. "
6,Eric Idle," Well how about this, sir: 'Bum Biters'.
            "
7,John Cleese," No ... not really ... I don't suppose you have any 
            general surveys of English Church architecture? "
8,Eric Idle," No, it's not really our line, sir. "
9,John Cleese," No, I see. Well, never mind I'll just take the 'Lord 
            Lieutenant in Nylons' then, and these two copies of 'Piggie Parade'. 
            Thank you. "
10,Eric Idle," Right, sir. "
11,Terry Jones, 
12,Eric Idle, 'Allo? 
13,Terry Jones, 
14,Eric Idle, Right. 
15,Terry Gilliam," Just these, then. "
16,Michael Palin," All right. This is a raid. My name is 
            Superintendent Gaskell and this is Sergeant Maddox. "
17,Eric Idle," Ah! Sir Philip Sidney. 'Tis good to see 
            thee on these shores again. "
18,Michael Palin, Shut up. 
19,Eric Idle," Your suit is fair and goodly cut. Was't 
            from Antwerp? "
20,Michael Palin," Shut up. It's a disguise. Right! Confiscate the 
            smutty books, Maddox. "
21,Eric Idle, Sir Philip!. Prithee nay! 
22,Michael Palin," Listen, mate! Don't come that Philip Sidney bit 
            with me. I'm not a bloody Tudor at all. I'm Gaskell of the Vice 
            Squad and this is Sergeant Maddox. ', "
23,Michael Palin, Maddox! Where's he gone? 
24,Eric Idle," Sir Philip, prithee rest awhile. "
25,Michael Palin," Look. This is the last time. I'm warning you, I'm 
            not Sir Philip Bleeding Sidney. I am Superintendent Harold Gaskell 
            and this is a raid. "
26,Eric Idle, That'll be 540 quid sir. 
27,Terry Gilliam," Oh, I'll just have this one then. "
28,Michael Palin, Maddox! 
29,Michael Palin, Right. 
30,Michael Palin, Don't you start! Maddox! 
31,Eric Idle," Farewell, good Sir Philip. "
32,Michael Palin," Hey, stop! "
33,Michael Palin," You'll never get away with this, you porn 
            merchant. Blimey! "
34,Michael Palin, Maddox! 
35,Michael Palin," Er, listen. My name is Caskell ... Superintendent 
            Caskell of Vice Squad. Myself and Sergeant Maddox are on a raid. We 
            are not Tudor people. We are the police. "
36,Terry Jones," Frances, what idleness is this? Why, good Sir 
            Philip Sidney, "
37,Michael Palin," ... Possibly... but I may be Superintendent 
            Gaskell of the Vice Squad. "
38,Terry Jones," Ah good, Sir Philip, thy sharp-tongued wit has not 
            deserted thee. Come. Let us eat and drink. Stay with us awhile. "
39,Michael Palin," All right, sir. I think I will. "
0,Michael Palin," . .. then did we bust the Harry Tony mob, who did 
            seek to import Scandinavian filth via Germany. For six years they 
            cleaned up a packet - the day I got whiff of them through a squealer 
            and within one week did a mop-up right good. They're now languishing 
            doing five years bird in Parkhurst. "
1,Terry Gilliam," Sir Philip. The Spaniards have landed in the 
            Netherlands. My Lord Walsingham needs you there forthwith. "
2,Michael Palin, Let's go. 
3,Michael Palin, Where are the Spaniards? 
4,Michael Palin," Right, you stay here, I'll go and get them. "
5,Michael Palin, Allo allo! What's going on here? 
6,Terry Jones," Ees nothing, Senor, ees just some literature.
            "
7,Michael Palin," I know what literature is, you dago dustbin. I 
            also know what porn is. "
8,Terry Jones," It is one of Lope De Vega's latest play, Senor.
            "
9,Michael Palin," 'Toledo Tit Parade'? What sort of play's that?
            "
10,Terry Jones," It's very visual, Senor. "
11,Michael Palin," Right. I'm taking this lot in the name of Her 
            Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth. "
12,Terry Jones," Oh, but Senor. "
13,Michael Palin," Don't give me any trouble. Just pile up these 
            baskets of filth and come with me. "
14,Terry Jones," The battle raged long and hard, but as night 
            fell Sidney overcame the Spaniards. 6,000 copies of 'Tits and Bums' 
            and 4,000 copies of 'Shower Sheila' were seized that day. The tide 
            of Spanish porn was stemmed. Sir Philip Sidney returned to London in 
            triumph. "
15,Terry Jones," Covered in glory, Sir Philip rode home to 
            Pensburst to see. his beloved wife... but all was not well. "
16,Michael Palin," Good evening all, my love. I have returned safe 
            from the Low Countries. "
17,Carol Cleveland," Oh, 'tis nothing, husband. "
18,Michael Palin, I can see 'tis something. 
19,Carol Cleveland, 'Tis one of Shakespeare's latest works. 
20,Michael Palin," Oh ... 'Gay Boys in Bondage' What, is't - 
            tragedy? Comedy? "
21,Carol Cleveland," 'Tis a... er... 'tis a story of man's great love for 
            his... fellow man. "
22,Michael Palin," How fortunate we are indeed to have such a poet 
            on these shores. "
23,Carol Cleveland," Indeed. How was the war, my lord? "
24,Michael Palin," The Spaniards were defeated thrice. Six dozen 
            chests of hardcore captured. "
25,Carol Cleveland, 
26,Michael Palin," Yes, good my wife, this fair coat trimmed with 
            ermine. "
27,Carol Cleveland, 
28,Michael Palin," No, no fair lady. The rest was too smutty. "
29,Michael Palin," Now, my good wife. Whilst I rest, read to me a 
            while from Shakespeare's 'Gay Boys in Bondage'. "
30,Carol Cleveland," Yes... my lord ... 'Gay Boys in Bondage' . .. Ken, 
            25, is a mounted policeman with a difference... and what a 
            difference. Even Roger is surprised and he's... "
31,Michael Palin, 'Tis like 'Hamlet' ... what a genius! 
32,Carol Cleveland," 'But who's going to do the cooking tonight? Roddy's 
            got a mouthful...' "
33,Graham Chapman," All right, this is a raid. "
34,Carol Cleveland, Oh! We are disgraced! 
35,Michael Palin," There you are, Maddox! "
36,Graham Chapman, Cut the chat... and get in the van. 
37,Michael Palin, Maddox! You recognize me... 
38,Graham Chapman," Indeed I do, Sir Philip Sidney, and sad I am to 
            see you caught up in this morass of filth, "
39,Carol Cleveland," Oh oh... the glorious name of Sidney is besmirched 
            ... all is lost ... oh alas the day. "
40,Michael Palin," Shut up! I know this man - this is my old mate 
            Sergeant Maddox... "
41,Graham Chapman, You'll do time for this. 
42,Michael Palin," Oh Maddox - it's me - Gaskell ... 'F' division 
            down at Acton ... Inspector Arthur Frodwell. "
43,Graham Chapman, Come on Sidney. 
44,Michael Palin," I'm not Sir Philip bleedin' Sidney .... and where 
            were you? We could have mopped up that Tudor shop... "
45,Graham Chapman, Oooh That's a good one! 
0,Carol Cleveland," It's nice here, darling, isn't it. "
1,John Cleese," It's beautiful, it's Paris all over again. "
2,Michael Palin," Excuse me, do you mind if I join you? "
3,John Cleese," Er, no... no... no... not at all. "
4,Michael Palin, Are you sure you don't mind? 
5,John Cleese," Yes, yes, absolutely. "
6,Michael Palin, You're sure I won't be disturbing you? 
7,John Cleese," No, no. "
8,Michael Palin," You're absolutely sure I won't be disturbing you?
            "
9,Carol Cleveland," No, no really. "
10,Michael Palin," Good. Because I don't want to disturb you. 
            Specially as you're being so kind about me not disturbing you. "
11,John Cleese," Oh, no, no, we don't mind, do we, darling? "
12,Carol Cleveland," Oh no, darling. "
13,Michael Palin," Good, so I can go ahead and join you then? Can I?
            "
14,Michael Palin, Won't be disturbing? 
15,Michael Palin," Good, good. You're very kind. "
16,John Cleese,". Well, it's not particularly disturbing. "
17,Michael Palin," No, absolutely, absolutely, that's what I always 
            say. "
18,John Cleese, We must be getting on. 
19,Michael Palin," I knew I'd disturb you ... I knew I'd disturb you 
            ... "
20,John Cleese," No, the only thing is, you see, we're going to be a 
            little bit late. "
21,Carol Cleveland, 
22,John Cleese," Well, just a little bit... I mean, we will be late if 
            we don't... "
23,Michael Palin," Oh, thank you. You're very kind. "
24,Carol Cleveland, 
0,John Cleese, 
1,Eric Idle," I've come for some free repetition of doubtful 
            words on an inland telegram. "
2,Terry Jones, Have you got the telegram in question? 
3,Eric Idle, I have the very thing here. 
4,Terry Jones," Well, slip it to me my good chap and let me eye the 
            contents. "
5,Eric Idle, At once Mr. Telegram Enquiry Man. 
6,Terry Jones, Thank you Mr. Customer Man. 
7,Eric Idle, Pat. 
8,Terry Jones, Pat? 
9,Eric Idle, My wife's name is not Pat at all. 
10,Terry Jones, No? 
11,Eric Idle, It's Bat. With a B. 
12,Terry Jones," And therefore I will take a quick look in the book.
            "
13,Eric Idle, Ripping. 
14,Terry Jones," You're quite right, old cock. There has been a 
            mistake. "
15,Eric Idle, I thought as much. What really does it say? 
16,Terry Jones," It say 'Go away you silly little bleeder. I am 
            having another man. Love Bat'. Quite some error. "
17,Eric Idle," Yes. She wouldn't call herself Pat, it's silly.
            "
18,Terry Jones," Daft, I call it. "
19,Eric Idle, Well it has been a pleasure working with you. 
20,Terry Jones," For me also it has been a pleasure. And that 
            concludes our little skit. "
21,John Cleese, 
0,John Cleese," Good evening. Tonight on 'Is 
            There' we examine the question, 'Is there a life after death?'. And 
            here to discuss it are three dead people... The late Sir Brian 
            Hardacre, former curator of the Imperial War Museum ... "
0,Michael Palin," Good doctor morning! Nice year for the time of 
            day! "
1,John Cleese, Come in. 
2,Michael Palin, Can I down sit? 
3,John Cleese, Certainly. 
4,Michael Palin," Well, now, not going to bush the doctor about the 
            beat too long. I'm going to come to point the straight immediately.
            "
5,John Cleese," Good, good. "
6,Michael Palin," My particular prob, or buglem bear, I've had 
            ages. For years, I've had it for donkeys. "
7,John Cleese, What? 
8,Michael Palin," I'm up to here with it, I'm sick to death. I 
            can't take you any longer so I've come to see it. "
9,John Cleese," Ah, now this is your problem with words. "
10,Michael Palin," This is my problem with words. Oh, that seems to 
            have cleared it. 'Oh I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee'. 
            Yes, that seems to be all right. Thank you very much. "
11,John Cleese," I see. But recently you have been having this 
            problem with your word order. "
12,Michael Palin," Well, absolutely, and what makes it worse, 
            sometimes at the end of a sentence I'll come out with the wrong 
            fusebox. "
13,John Cleese, Fusebox? 
14,Michael Palin," And the thing about saying the wrong word is a) I 
            don't notice it, and b) sometimes orange water given bucket of 
            plaster. "
15,John Cleese," Yes, tell me more about your problem. "
16,Michael Palin," Well as I say, you'd just be talking and out'll 
            pudenda the wrong word and ashtray's your uncle. So I'm really 
            strawberry about it. "
17,John Cleese, Upset? 
18,Michael Palin," It's so embarrassing when my wife and I go to an 
            orgy. "
19,John Cleese, A party? 
20,Michael Palin," No, an orgy. We live in Esher. "
21,John Cleese, Quite. 
22,Michael Palin," ,That's what I said. such a bloody whack the 
            diddle fa di la, fo di la, 1o do di ... do di do, rum fum. "
23,John Cleese," Mr. Burrows, this is no common problem; You are 
            suffering from a disease so rare that it hasn't got a name. Not yet. 
            But it will have. Oh yes. This is the opportunity I've been waiting 
            for. The chance of a lifetime! "
0,John Cleese," Well, I feel that they have missed the whole 
            point of my disease. "
1,John Cleese," Yes, well you see, they've dragged in all this 
            irrelevant mush... "
2,John Cleese," Well at the moment I am working on a new 
            disease, which I hope to turn into a musical, but, primarily we are 
            working on a re-make of my first disease and this time we're hoping 
            to do it properly. "
3,John Cleese," Well now, what seems to be the matter? "
4,Michael Palin, The next sketch starts after some silly noises.
0,Michael Palin, Come in. 
1,Graham Chapman," I wondered if I could have a word with you for a 
            moment. "
2,Michael Palin," By all means ... by all means, sir. Do sit down. "
3,Graham Chapman, Thank you. 
4,Michael Palin," Now then, a glass of sherry? "
5,Graham Chapman, No... no thank you... 
6,Michael Palin, 
7,Graham Chapman," Well, if you're having some, yes then, perhaps, 
            vicar. "
8,Michael Palin, 
9,Graham Chapman," Well in that case I won't, don't worry. "
10,Michael Palin," You see, if I split what's left, there'd be hardly 
            any left for me at all. "
11,Graham Chapman," Well, I'm not a great sherry drinker. "
12,Michael Palin," Good! So, I can have it all ... now then what's the 
            problem? "
13,Graham Chapman," Well, just recently I've begun to worry about...
            "
14,Michael Palin," Ah! I've found another bottle! You can have some 
            now if you want to. "
15,Graham Chapman," Well... yes, perhaps a little... "
16,Michael Palin," Oh you don't have to. I can drink the whole bottle.
            "
17,Graham Chapman," Well in that case, no... "
18,Michael Palin, Good! That's another bottle for me. Do go on. 
19,Graham Chapman, I've begun to worry recently that... 
20,Michael Palin, Come in! 
21,Michael Palin," Ah, Mr. Husband ... this is Mr. Kirkham, one of my 
            parishioners, this is Mr. Husband of the British Sherry 
            Corporation... "
22,Graham Chapman," Look, look, perhaps I'd better come back later...
            "
23,Michael Palin," No, no ... no do stay here. Have a sherry... you 
            won't be long will you, Husband? "
24,Michael Palin," There we are... there we are, Mr. Husband. Now, how 
            about you, Mr. Kirkham? "
25,Graham Chapman, Well only if there's enough. 
26,Michael Palin," Oh well, there's not much now. "
27,Graham Chapman," Oh, in that case... no... I won't bother. "
28,Michael Palin, 
29,Michael Palin, And how many glasses is that? 
30,Michael Palin," That's excellent, Husband, excellent. "
31,Michael Palin," Yes... and I could have dry sherry on the roof and 
            Amontillado in the underground tank! "
32,Michael Palin," Excellent work, Husband, excellent work. "
33,Michael Palin," Terrific. Now then, Mr. Kirkham "
34,Graham Chapman," Well, it's just that recently I've begun to worry 
            about... "
35,Michael Palin," Well, look... "
36,Graham Chapman," I sometimes ask myself- does the Bible intend...
            "

            peril, for I have two pistols here. I know one of them isn't loaded 
            any more, but the other one is, so that's one of you dead for 
            sure...or just about for sure anyway. It certainly wouldn't be worth 
            your while risking it because I'm a very good shot. I practice every 
            day...well, not absolutely every day, but most days in the week. I 
            expect I must practice, oh, at least four or five times a week...or 
            more, really, but some weekends, like last weekend, there really 
            wasn't the time, so that brings the average down a bit. I should say 
            it's a solid four days' practice a week...At least...I mean...I 
            reckon I could hit that tree over there. Er...the one just behind 
            that hillock. The little hillock, not the big one on the...you see 
            the three trees over there? Well, the one furthest away on the 
            right... "
3,John Cleese," What's the... the one like that with the leaves 
            that are sort of regularly veined and the veins go right out with a 
            sort of um..."
4,Carol Cleveland, Serrated?
5,John Cleese, Serrated edges.
6,Eric Idle, A willow!
7,John Cleese, Yes.
8,Eric Idle, That's nothing like a willow.
9,John Cleese," Well it doesn't matter, anyway. I can hit it seven 
            times out of ten, that's the point."
10,Eric Idle, Never a willow.
11,John Cleese," Shut up! It's a hold-up, not a Botany lesson. Now, 
            no false moves please. I want you to hand over all the lupins you've 
            got."
12,Terry Jones, Lupins?
13,John Cleese," Yes, lupins. Come on, come on."
14,Eric Idle," What do you mean, lupins?"
15,John Cleese, Don't try to play for time.
16,Eric Idle," I'm not, but... the *flower* lupin?"
17,John Cleese," Yes, that's right."
18,Terry Jones, Well we haven't got any lupins.
19,Carol Cleveland, Honestly.
20,John Cleese," Look, my friends. I happen to know that this is the 
            Lupin Express."
21,Terry Jones, Damn!
22,Carol Cleveland," Oh, here you are."
23,John Cleese," In a bunch, in a bunch!"
24,Terry Jones, Sorry.
25,John Cleese," Come on, Concorde! "
26,John Cleese," Here we are, I'll be back. "
0,Eric Idle," Morning, Mrs. Trepidatious. "
1,Graham Chapman," Oh, I don't know what's good about it, 
            my right arm's hanging off something awful. "
2,Eric Idle," Oh, you want to have that seen to. "
3,Graham Chapman," What, by that Dr Morrison? He's killed 
            more patients than I've had severe boils. "
4,Eric Idle, What do the stars say? 
5,Graham Chapman," Well, Petula Clark says burst them 
            early, but David Frost... "
6,Eric Idle," No, the stars in the paper, you cloth-eared heap 
            of anteater's catarrh, the zodiacal signs, the horoscopic fates, the 
            astrological portents, the omens, the genethliac prognostications, 
            the mantalogical harbingers, the vaticinal utterances, the fatidical 
            premonitory uttering of the mantalogical omens - what do the 
            bleeding stars in the paper predict, forecast, prophesy, foretell, 
            prognosticate... "
7,Michael Palin, And this is where you at home can join in. 
8,Eric Idle," ... forebode, bode, augur, spell, foretoken, (the 
            audience joins in) presage, portend, foreshow, foreshadow, forerun, 
            herald, point to, betoken, indicate! "
9,Graham Chapman, I don't know. 
10,Eric Idle, What are you? 
11,Graham Chapman, I'm Nesbitt. 
12,Eric Idle, There's not a zodiacal sign called Nesbitt... 
13,Graham Chapman," All right, Derry and Toms. "
14,Eric Idle, 
15,Graham Chapman, Well what does it presage? 
16,Eric Idle," You have green, scaly skin, and a soft yellow 
            underbelly with a series of fin-like ridges running down your spine 
            and tail. Although lizard like in shape, you can grow anything up to 
            thirty feet in length with huge teeth that can bite off great rocks 
            and trees. You inhabit arid sub-tropical zones and wear spectacles.
            "
17,Graham Chapman," It's very good about the spectacles.
            "
18,Eric Idle, It's amazing. 
19,Graham Chapman," Mm ... what's yours, Irene? "
20,Eric Idle, Basil. 
21,Graham Chapman," I'm sorry, what's yours, Basil? "
22,Eric Idle," No. That's my star sign, Basil... "
23,Graham Chapman, There isn't a... 
24,Eric Idle," Yes there is ... Aquarius, Sagittarius, Derry and 
            Toms, Basil. June 21st to June 22nd. "
25,Graham Chapman," Well, what does it say? "
26,Eric Idle," You have green, scaly skin and a series of yellow 
            underbellies running down your spine and tail ... "
27,Graham Chapman, That's exactly the same! 
28,Eric Idle, Try number one ... what's Aquarius? 
29,Graham Chapman, It's a zodiacal sign. 
30,Eric Idle," I know that, what does it say in the paper Mrs. 
            Flan-and-pickle? "
31,Graham Chapman," All right... Oh! It says, 'a wonderful 
            day ahead'. You will be surrounded by family and friends. Roger 
            Moore will drop in for lunch, bringing Tony Curtis with him. In the 
            afternoon a substantial cash sum will come your way. In the evening 
            Petula Clark will visit your home accompanied by Mike Samrues 
            singers. She will sing for you in your own living room. Before you 
            go to bed, Peter Wyngarde will come and declare his undying love for 
            you. "
32,Eric Idle, Urghhl What's Scorpio? 
33,Graham Chapman," Oh, that's very good. 'You will have 
            lunch with a school friend of Duane Eddy's, who will insist on 
            whistling some of Duane's greatest instrumental hits. In the 
            afternoon you will die, you will be buried...' "
0,Terry Jones, Good morning. 
1,Eric Idle," Oh, morning, doctor. "
2,Terry Jones," How's the old arm this morning, Mrs. Ikon? "
3,Graham Chapman," Oh, it's still hanging off at the 
            shoulder. "
4,Terry Jones," Good, well lees have a look at it, shall we? "
5,Terry Jones, What's that doing here? 
6,Graham Chapman, 
7,Terry Jones, Hand over the money. 
8,Graham Chapman," Thank you, doctor. "
9,Michael Palin," Morning, Mr. Hemon ... How are we today? "
10,Terry Gilliam," Not too bad, doctor. "
11,Michael Palin," OK, take it easy ... "
12,Terry Gilliam, No. 
13,Michael Palin, Righto. 
14,Michael Palin," Ah, Mr. Rodgets, have you got your 
            unemployment benefit please? Right. Well can you write me a cheque 
            then... please? "
15,Michael Palin," Thank you very much. Soon have you down to 
            nothing. Ah, Mr. Millichope. "
0,Eric Idle," Hello. Should there be another television 
            channel, or should there not? On tonight's program the Minister for 
            Broadcasting, The Right Honorable Mr. Ian Throat MP. "

12,Eric Idle, Sir Abe? 
13,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
14,Eric Idle, Patrick. 
15,Michael Palin, No. 
16,Eric Idle," Well there you have it. Two say will, two say 
            won't. We'll be back again next week, and next week's 'Great Debate' 
            will be about Government Interference in Broadcasting and will be 
            cancelled mysteriously. "

3,Michael Palin," Ladies, may I introduce to you the man who 
            prophesied that a German monarch would soon embroil this country in 
            continental affairs. "
4,Carol Cleveland," Oh, how so, my lord? "
5,Terry Jones," Madam, you will recall that prior to his 
            accession our gracious sovereign George had become involved in the 
            long standing Northern War, through his claims to Bremen and Verdun. 
            These duchies would provide an outlet to the sea of the utmost value 
            to Hanover. The Treaty of Westphalia has assigned them to Sweden.
            "
6,Michael Palin, In 1648. 
7,Terry Jones, Exactly. 
8,Michael Palin," Meanwhile Frederick William of Denmark, taking 
            advantage of the absence of Charles XII, seized them; 1712. "
9,Carol Cleveland, It all falls into place. More wine? 
10,Michael Palin," Oh, thank you. "
11,Terry Jones," However, just prior to his accession, George 
            had made an alliance with Frederick William of Prussia, on the 
            grounds of party feeling. "
12,Michael Palin," While Frederick William had married George's 
            only daughter. "
13,Carol Cleveland, I remember the wedding. 
14,Terry Jones," But chiefly through concern at the concerted 
            action against Charles XII... "
15,John Cleese, Stand and deliver. 
16,John Cleese," The same. And now my lords, my ladies ... your 
            lupins, please. "
17,Terry Jones, Our what? 
18,John Cleese," Oh, come come, don't play games with me my Lord of 
            Buckingham. "
19,Terry Jones, What can you mean? 
20,John Cleese, 
21,John Cleese," In a bunch, in a bunch. "
22,Michael Palin," He seeks them here ... he seeks them there ... 
            he seeks those lupins everywhere. The murdering blackguard! He's 
            taken all our lupins. "
23,Carol Cleveland, 
24,Terry Jones, Oh you tricked him! 
25,Michael Palin, 
26,John Cleese," Don't worry, I've... I've brought you 
                something. "
27,Michael Palin, Medicine at last? 
28,John Cleese, No. 
29,Michael Palin, Food? 
30,John Cleese, No. 
31,Michael Palin," Some blankets perhaps... clothes... wood 
                for the fire... "
32,John Cleese, No. Lupins! 
33,Michael Palin, 
34,John Cleese, 
35,Michael Palin, I'm sick to bloody death of them. 
36,Terry Jones, So am I. 
37,Michael Palin," She's bloody dying and all you bring us 
                is lupins. All we've eaten mate for the last four bleeding weeks 
                is lupin soup, roast lupin, steamed lupin, braised lupin in 
                lupin sauce, lupin in the basket with sautéed lupins, lupin 
                meringue pie, lupin. sorbet... we sit on lupins, we sleep in 
                lupins, we feed the cat on lupins, we burn lupins, we even wear 
                the bloody things! "
38,John Cleese, Looks very smart. 
39,Michael Palin," Oh shut up! We're sick to death with the 
                stench of them. "
40,John Cleese, Like what? 
41,Michael Palin," Like gold and silver and clothes and 
                wood and jewels and... "
42,John Cleese," Hang on, I'll get a piece of paper. "
43,Terry Jones," This, coupled with the presence of 
                    Peter and his Prussians at Mecklenburg and Charles and his 
                    Swedes in Pomerania, made George and Stanhope eager to come 
                    to terms with France. "
44,Michael Palin," Meanwhile, a breach had now opened 
                    with... "
45,Michael Palin," Oh no, not again. "
46,Terry Jones, Come on. 
47,John Cleese," Stand and deliver again! Your money, your 
                    jewelry, your ... hang on. "
48,Terry Jones, 
49,John Cleese," Your watches, your lace, your spittoons...
                    "
50,John Cleese, Here we are. 
0,Eric Idle," Well it may be the end of that, but it's 
            certainly far from the end of- well in fact it's the beginning - 
            well not quite the beginning - well certainly nearer the beginning 
            than the end - well yes damn it, it is to all interns and purposes 
            the beginning of this year's Ideal Loon Exhibition, sponsored by the 
            'Daily Express'. "
0,Eric Idle," Yet fear, not like an aged florin, can so 
            disseminate men's eyes, that fortune, straining at a kissing touch 
            may stop her ceaseless search to sport amidst the rampant thrust of 
            time, and bring the thing undone to pass by that with which the cock 
            may chance an arm. "
1,John Cleese," Well that's all very well, sir, but this is an 
            off-license. "
2,Eric Idle," Oh. Just a bottle of sherry then, please. "
3,John Cleese, Certainly... Amontillado? 
4,Eric Idle," Yes, I think Amonfillado, finely grown ... well 
            chosen from the casque of Pluto's hills, cell'd deep within the 
            vinous soil of Spain, wrench'd thence from fiery regions of the 
            sun... "
5,John Cleese," Yes, yes sir. Just one bottle? "
6,Eric Idle," Just one bottle. Just one jot. Just one tittle. 
            That's the lot. "
7,John Cleese," There we are, sir. That'll be a pound, please.
            "
8,Eric Idle," A pound a pound and all around abound A pound 
            found found Lost lost the cost till was't embossed... "
9,John Cleese," Excuse me, sir. "
10,Eric Idle," Yes, good victualler, nature's trencherman, mine 
            honest tapster... "
11,John Cleese, I was just wondering. Are you a poet? 
12,Eric Idle," No, no, I'm a solicitor... well versed within the 
            written law of man, can m those who need... "
13,John Cleese, Oh' shut up. 
14,Eric Idle, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've caught poetry. 
15,John Cleese," Oh really? Well, don't worry, sir - I used to 
            suffer from short stories. "
16,Eric Idle, Really? When? 
17,John Cleese," Oh, once upon a time ... there' lived in 
            Wiltshire a young Chap called Dennis Moore. Now Dennis was a 
            highwayman by profession ... "
18,John Cleese," Here we are again, Mr. Jenkins. "
19,Terry Jones," Meanwhile Frederick William bushy engaged in 
            defending against the three great powers the province of Silesia...
            "
20,Michael Palin," ... which he had seized in the War of the 
            Austrian succession against his word. "
21,Carol Cleveland," Yes, I remember. "
22,John Cleese," My lords, my ladies, on your feet, please. "
23,Carol Cleveland, What do you want? Why are you here? 
24,John Cleese," Why are any of us here? I mean, when you get down 
            to it, it's all so meaningless, isn't it, I mean what do any of us 
            want... "
25,Terry Jones," No, no, what do you want now? "
26,John Cleese," Oh I see, oh just the usual things, a little place 
            of my own, the fight girl... "
27,Michael Palin," No, no, no! What do you want from us? "
28,John Cleese," Oh sorry. Urn, your gold, your silver, your 
            jewelry. "
29,Terry Jones, You've taken it all. 
30,Carol Cleveland, This is all we've got left. 
31,John Cleese, That's nice. I'll have them. Come on. 
32,Terry Jones, You'd better take the bloody lupin too. 
33,John Cleese," Thank you very much, I've gone through that stage.
            "
34,Michael Palin, What you got for us today then. 
35,John Cleese," Well I've managed to find you four very nice 
              silver spoons Mr. Jenkins. "
36,Michael Palin, 
37,Terry Jones," Bloody silver. Won't have it in the 
              house. "
38,Michael Palin," Yes, why don't you go out and steal 
              something nice like some Venetian silver. "
39,Terry Jones, Or a Velasquez for the outside loo. 
40,John Cleese, Oh all right. 
41,John Cleese, What did you sing? 
42,John Cleese," Wait a tic ... blimey, this redistribution of 
                  wealth is trickier than I thought. "
0,Micheal Palin," Good evening and welcome to another edition of 
            'Prejudice' - the show that gives you 'a chance to have a go at

            Yidds, Jocks, Polacks, Paddies and Dagoes. "
1,Micheal Palin," Tonight's show comes live from the tiny village 
            of Rabid in Buckinghamshire, and our first question tonight is from 
            a Mrs. Elizabeth Scrint who says she is going on a Mediterranean 
            cruise next week and can't find anything wrong with the Syrians. 
            Well, Mrs. Scrint, apart from being totally unprincipled left-wing 
            troublemakers, the Syrians are also born skivers, they're dirty, 
            smelly and untrustworthy, and, of course, they're friends of the 
            awful gippos. "
2,John Cleese," Our first contestant is a hairdresser from...
            "
3,Michael Palin, I never did like that kind of person... ! 
4,John Cleese, Halt! Halt! 
5,Terry Jones," I thought you should have won. I mean, judicially 
            you swept the board ... all right, he has posture, but where was he 
            in the summing up? "
6,Eric Idle," Oh shut up Melford, there's always next year. "
0,Eric Idle," There now follows a Party Political Broadcast 
            on behalf of the Conservative and Unionist Party. "
1,John Cleese," Good evening. Figures talk. We have already 
            fulfilled over three of our election pledges before the end of our 
            second year of good Conservative rule. And, what is more "
2,Eric Idle," No, no, no, no... look, luv, it's and... "
3,John Cleese, 
4,Eric Idle," Well, don't think of them. Just count four 
            in your head. "
5,John Cleese," And ... one and fur-ther two and three and ... 
            no, I can't really... "
6,Eric Idle," Yes, well come on and do it with me, come 
            on. And ... "
7,Eric Idle," And point 'unemployment' with your finger.
            "
8,John Cleese, I see. I can do it when you're here. 
9,Eric Idle," I won't be far away. All right, Neville 
            love, we're going from 'unemployment' through 'pensions' into 'good 
            government is strong government' and the walk down, all fight? And 
            ... cue, love. "
10,John Cleese," And fur-ther-more we hope that we can stop the 
            n's-ing un-em-ploy-ment at a stroke or e-yen quick-er. "
11,Eric Idle," That's where you'll get the bunting and the 
            ticker tape, Chris. Right, big smiles, everybody, remember you're 
            cabinet ministers. And relax. "

11,John Cleese, Yes ... I know... but... er ... 
12,John Cleese," You see what is worrying me, sergeant major, 
            is... MacPherson I'll make it a gud'un, sir! "
13,John Cleese, Er... MacPherson... 
14,John Cleese," Sergeant major, what's this man's name? "
15,John Cleese," No, no, no, no. "
16,John Cleese, What's that? 
17,John Cleese," Well, can't we get him out of it? "
18,John Cleese," Well, there must be someone else who can advise 
            us? "
19,Michael Palin, 
20,Carol Cleveland, 
21,Michael Palin, Thank you. 
0,John Cleese," Right, sergeant major - there's no time to lose.
            "
1,John Cleese, No time to lose. 
2,John Cleese, No time... no time to lose. 
3,John Cleese," Yes, that's right, yes. "
4,John Cleese, Right. 
5,John Cleese," Well, it's in perfectly common parlance. "
6,John Cleese, Oh never mind... right... no time to lose. 
7,John Cleese, What? 
8,John Cleese," Look, I don't think you've quite got the hang of 
            this phrase, sergeant major. "
9,Eric Idle," Morning, no time to lose ... "
10,Michael Palin," Well, I was thinking of using it... er... like..., 
            well... good morning dear, what is in no time to lose? "
11,Eric Idle," Er yes... well... you've not quite got the 
            hang of that, have you. "
12,Eric Idle, 
13,Michael Palin," Yes, that's right. "
14,Eric Idle, Yes... good... 
15,Michael Palin," You see my wife and I have never had a great deal to 
            say to each other ... "
16,Eric Idle," Yes, well, what we normally suggest for a 
            beginner such as yourself, is that you put your alarm clock back ten 
            minutes in the morning, so you can wake up, look at the clock and 
            use the phrase immediately. "
17,Michael Palin, Yes. 
18,Eric Idle," All right - I'll be the alarm clock. When I go 
            off, look at me and use the phrase, OK? "
19,Michael Palin, No! Time to lose! 
20,Eric Idle, No... No time to lose. 
21,Michael Palin, No time to lose? 
22,Eric Idle, No time to lose. 
23,Michael Palin, No time to lose. 
24,Eric Idle," No - to lose... like Toulouse in France. No 
            time Toulouse. "
25,Michael Palin, No time too lose... 
26,Eric Idle, No time Toulouse. 
27,Michael Palin, No time Toulouse... 
28,Eric Idle, Not - no time to loser 
29,Michael Palin, No - no time to lose! 
30,John Cleese," Anyway, no time to lose, sergeant major. "
31,John Cleese," Right, here are the plans sergeant major, good 
            luck. "
32,John Cleese," And good luck to you, MacDonald. "
33,John Cleese," Very good, sergeant major. "
34,Eric Idle," Yes, excellent... "
35,John Cleese," Well, that's the mission - now here's the method. 
            RSM Urdoch will lull the enemy into a false sense of security by 
            giving them large quantifies of money, a good home, and a steady 
            job. Then, when they're upstairs with the wife, Sapper MacDonald 
            will hurl himself at the secret documents, destroying them and 
            himself. Well, that's the plan, the time is now 19.42 hours. I want 
            you to get to bed, have a' good night's rest and be up on parade 
            early in the morning. Thank you for listening and thank you for a 
            lovely supper. "
0,John Cleese," Penguins, yes, penguins. What relevance do 
            penguins have to the furtherance of medical science? Well, strangely 
            enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe. It was from such an 
            unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a 
            sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin. 
            James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and 
            conceived the potentiality of steam power. Would Albert Einstein 
            ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been 
            clever? All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the 
            dark. Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried? 
            Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadn't by pure chance 
            spent years working at the problem? Are these amazing breakthroughs 
            ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study? Of 
            course not. What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must 
            have been wrong. Nevertheless scientists believe that these 
            penguins, these comic flightless web-footed little bastards may 
            finally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the 
            human mind. Professor Rosewall of the Laver Institute. "
1,Graham Chapman, 
2,Graham Chapman," The first thing that Dr Kramer came up with was 
            that the penguin has a much smaller brain than the man. This 
            postulate formed the fundamental basis of all his thinking and 
            remained with him until his death. "
3,Graham Chapman," Now we've taken this theory one stage further. 
            If we increase the size of the penguin until it is the same height 
            as the man and then compare the relative brain size, we now find 
            that the penguin's brain is still smaller. But, and this is the 
            point, it is larger than it was. "
4,Michael Palin," For a penguin to have the same size of brain as a 
            man the penguin would have to be over sixty-six feet high. "
5,Graham Chapman," This theory has become known as the waste of 
            time theory and was abandoned in 1956. "
6,Eric Idle," These IQ. tests were thought to contain an unfair 
            cultural bias against the penguin. For example, it didn't take into 
            account the penguins' extremely poor educational system. To devise a 
            fairer system of test, a team of our researchers spent eighteen 
            months in Antarctica living like penguins, and subsequently dying 
            like penguins - only quicker - proving that the penguin is a clever 
            little sod in his own environment. "
7,Graham Chapman," Therefore we devised tests to be given to the 
            penguins in the fourth set ... I do beg your pardon, in their own 
            environment. "
8,Michael Palin, Net! 
9,Graham Chapman, Shh! 
10,Terry Jones," What is the next number in this sequence - 2, 
            4, 6. . . "
11,Terry Jones, Did he say eight? ... 
12,Graham Chapman," The environmental barrier had been removed but 
            we'd hit another: the language barrier. The penguins could not speak 
            English and were therefore unable to give the answers. This problem 
            was removed in the next series of experiments by asking the same 
            questions to the penguins and to a random group of 
            non-English-speaking humans in the same conditions. "
13,Terry Jones," What is the next number? 2, 4, 6... "
14,Eric Idle, . . . Hello? 
15,Graham Chapman," The results of these tests were most 
            illuminating. The penguins' scores were consistently equal to those 
            of the non-English-speaking group. "
16,Eric Idle," These enquiries led to certain changes at the BBC 
            ... "

10,Eric Idle," Yes, you're fight. The answer was, of course, 
            number two! "
11,Eric Idle," Yes, well done, Mrs. L of Leicester, Mrs. B of 
            Buxton and Mrs. G of Gotwick, the loony was of course the writer, Sir 
            Walter Scott. "

            Colyer -- these two now at the head of the field from Mrs. Brown, 
            Mrs. Atkins, Mrs. Parkinson, Mrs. Warner and Mrs. Rudd -- all still at 
            Mr. Philips's. Mrs. Penguin making the running now, challenged 
            strongly by Mrs. Casey, Mrs. Casey coming very fast on the inside, 
            it's going to be Mrs. Casey coming from behind. Now she's making a 
            break on the outside, Mrs. Penguin running ... and at the line, 
            it's Mrs. Casey who's got it by a short head from Mrs. Penguin in 
            second place, Mrs. Parkinson in third, Mrs. Rudd, Mrs. Colyer, Mrs. 
            Warner and there's Mrs. Griffiths who's remained unswapped. "
5,Michael Palin," Well, a very exciting race there, and I have with me now the 
            man who owned and trained the winner, Mrs. Casey -- Mr. Casey. Well 
            done, Jack. "
6,Michael Palin," Well, were you at all surprised about this, Jack? "
7,Michael Palin," Well, thank you very much indeed, Jack. We must leave you now 
            because it's time for the team event. "
8,Eric Idle,"  Hello, and a very warm welcome from the Tower ballroom suite 
            at Reading, where there's very little in it, they're neck and 
            neck, crop and grummit, real rack and saddle, brick and bucket, 
            horse and tooth, cap and thigh, arse over tip, they're absolutely 
            birds of a feather, there's not a new pin in it, you couldn't get 
            a melon between them. Well, now, everything rests on the formation 
            event and here comes the North West with the Mambo. Maestro, take 
            it away, please. "
9,Michael Palin,"  And now it's time for Rugby League, and highlights of this 
            afternoon's game between Keighley and Hull Kingston Rovers. "
10,Eric Idle, 
11,Eric Idle," And there goes his wife into the scrum. And Hull have got the 
            heel against the head. Doing nicely with this scrum, some very 
            good picking here. Warrington's picked her up, is he going to let 
            her go, Wrigley's with him, grand lad is this. "
12,Eric Idle," Well, that was right on the whistle, Rovers walkin' it there, 
            winnin' easily by twenty-six points to two. "
13,Michael Palin," Just a reminder that on `Match of the Day' tonight you can see 
            highlights of two of this afternoon's big games: Mrs. Robinson v 
            Manchester United and Southampton v Mr. Rogers, a rather unusual 
            game that. And here's a late result... Coventry nil, Mr. Johnson's 
            Una three -- Coventry going down at home, there. Just a little 
            reminder that the next sport you can see on BBC1 will be 9.20 on 
            Wednesday night, when `Wife Swapping with Coleman' comes live from 
            my place. Till then, goodnight. "
0,Eric Idle," There they go, the credits of the year. Credits 
            that you and the Society voted as the credits that brought the most 
            credit to the Society. Sadly, the man who designed them cannot be 
            with us tonight, as he is at home asleep, but we are going to wake 
            him up and tell him the good news."
1,Eric Idle," Are you there in Bristol, Arthur Briggs...? "
2,Michael Palin, 
3,Eric Idle," And now for the moment you've all been waiting 
            for..."
4,Eric Idle," No, not that moment. Although that moment is not 
            coming, in a moment. The moment I'm talking about is the moment when 
            we present the award for the cast with the most awards award, and 
            this year is no exception. Ladies and gentlemen will you join me and 
            welcome please, the winners of this year's Mountbatten trophy, Show 
            business's highest accolade, the cast of the Dirty Vicar sketch."
5,Eric Idle," Well, now let us see the performances which 
            brought them this award. Let us see the Dirty Vicar Sketch."
0,Carol Cleveland," Have you seen Lady Windermere's new carriage, 
            dear? "
1,Caron Garden, Absolutely enchanting! 
2,Carol Cleveland, Isn't it! 
3,Graham Chapman," (Graham) The new vicar to see you, m'lady. "
4,Carol Cleveland," Ah, send him in, Chivers. "
5,Graham Chapman," Certainly, m'lady. "
6,Carol Cleveland," Now, how is your tea, dear? A little more 
            water perhaps? "
7,Caron Garden, Thank you. It is delightful as it is. 
8,Graham Chapman," The Reverend Ronald Simms, the Dirty Vicar of St 
            Michael's ... ooh! "
9,Terry Jones," (Terry J.) Cor, what a lovely bit of stuff. I'd 
            like to get my fingers around those knockers. "
10,Carol Cleveland, How do you find the vicarage? 
11,Terry Jones, I like tits! 
12,Carol Cleveland, Oh vicar! vicar! 
13,Terry Jones," Oh my goodness. I do beg your pardon. How dreadful! 
            The first day in my new parish, I completely ... so sorry! "
14,Carol Cleveland, 
15,Graham Chapman," Certainly, m'lady. "
16,Terry Jones, 
17,Carol Cleveland," As I was saying, how do you find the new 
            vicarage? "
18,Terry Jones," Oh yes, certainly, yes indeed, I find the grounds 
            delightful, and the servants most attentive and particularly the 
            little serving maid with the great big knockers, and when she gets 
            going... "
19,Eric Idle," Well, there we are, another year has been too soon 
            alas ended and I think none more than myself can be happier at this 
            time than I ... am. "
