0,Michael Palin, 
1,Eric Idle," This is a great moment for us, Joseph. "
2,Terry Jones, It is a great moment for France. 
3,Eric Idle," Ah, oui! "
4,Terry Jones," First ascent in a hot-air balloon, by the 
            Montgolfier brothers - 1783. I can see us now... just after 
            Montesquieu and just before Mozart. "
5,Eric Idle, I think I'll go and wash ... 
6,Terry Jones, Good luck. 
7,Eric Idle," Oh ... it's quite easy, really ... I just slap a 
            little water on my face, then... "
8,Terry Jones, No... good luck for tomorrow. 
9,Eric Idle," Oh I see, yes. You too. Yours has been the work.
            "
10,Terry Jones," Let us hope for a safe ascent... and don't use my 
            flannel. "
11,Eric Idle," You know, when you showed me the plans in Paris, 
            I could not believe that we should be the first men who would fly.
            "
12,Terry Jones, Yes ... it's wonderful. 
13,Eric Idle, I am so excited I could hardly wash. 
14,Terry Jones," Yes ... I too have had some difficulty washing 
            these past few days. "
15,Eric Idle," Still, what is washing when we are on the verge 
            of a great scientific breakthrough? "
16,Terry Jones, Jacques... 
17,Eric Idle," Yes, Joseph... "
18,Terry Jones," I have not been washing very thoroughly for many 
            years now. "
19,Eric Idle," What do you mean? You must have been washing your 
            face? "
20,Terry Jones," Oh yes, my face, I wash my face... but my legs... 
            my stomach ... my chest, they're filthy. "
21,Eric Idle," Well, I don't wash my stomach every day. "
22,Terry Jones, 
23,Eric Idle," This is nothing, Joseph... "
24,Terry Jones," I don't want to see anyone, O'Toole... tell him to 
            go away. "
25,Eric Idle," Well, it's getting late. I must go and have a 
            wash. "
26,Terry Jones, What will you be washing? 
27,Eric Idle," Oh ... just my face and neck ... perhaps my 
            feet... and possibly ... but no ... no ... lock up the plans, 
            Joseph... tomorrow they will make us the toast of France. 'The first 
            ascent by the Montgolfier brothers in a balloon'. Just after 
            Ballcock and just before Bang... what a position! "
28,Graham Chapman," So, on June 7th, 1783, the Montgolfier 
            brothers had a really good wash ... starting on his face and arms, 
            Joseph Michael Montgolfier went on to scrub his torso, his legs and 
            his naughty bits, before rinsing his whole body. That June night, he 
            and his brother between them washed seventeen square feet of body 
            area. They used a kilo and a half of catholic soap and nearly 
            fourteen gallons of nice hot water. It was indeed an impressive 
            sight. "
29,Graham Chapman," Next week on 'The Golden Age of Ballooning', 
            we examine the work of Girlsher and Coxwell, the English balloonists 
            who ascended to a height of seven miles in 1862 without washing. 
            There is also a book called 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' published 
            by the BBC to coincide with the series. It's in an attractive 
            hand-tooled binding, is priced L5 and failure to buy it will make 
            you liable to a 50 pound fine or three months' imprisonment. There's 
            also a record of someone reading the book of 'The Golden Age of 
            Ballooning', a crochet-work bedspread with the words 'The Golden Age 
            of Ballooning' on it, available from the BBC, price 18 pounds (or 
            five months' imprisonment) and there are matching toilet-seat covers 
            and courtesy mats with illustrations of many of the balloons 
            mentioned. Also available is a life-size model frog which croaks the 
            words 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' and an attractive Bakelite case 
            for storing motorway construction plans in, made in the shape of a 
            balloon. And now, another chance to see a repeat of this morning's 
            re-run of last night's second showing of episode 'two of the 
            award-winning series 'The Golden Age of Ballooning'. "
30,Carol Cleveland," Oh Joseph, all you think about is balloons... 
            all you talk about is balloons. Your beautiful house is fun of bits 
            and pieces of balloons... your books are all about balloons... every 
            time you sing a song, it is in some way obliquely connected with 
            balloons... everything you eat has to have 'balloon' incorporated in 
            the title... your dogs are an called 'balloon'... you tie balloons 
            to your ankles in the evenings. "
31,Terry Jones, I don't do that! 
32,Carol Cleveland," Well, no, you don't do that, but you do duck 
            down and shout 'Hey! Balloons!' when there are none about. Your 
            whole life is becoming obsessively balloonic, you know. Why do I 
            have to hang from this bloody gas bag all day? Don't I mean anything 
            to you? "
33,Terry Jones, 
34,Carol Cleveland, Oh there you go again! 
35,Terry Jones, Don't waggle! 
36,Eric Idle," I've run your bath for you, Joseph. "
37,Terry Jones," It's all right, we've done the difficult bit. "
38,Eric Idle," Well, don't forget we have our special guest 
            coming this evening. "
39,Terry Jones, Oh? 
40,Eric Idle," Don't tell me you have forgotten already. The man 
            who is giving us thousands of francs for our experiments. "
41,Terry Jones, What man? 
42,Eric Idle, Louis XIV! 
43,Terry Jones, Isn't he dead? 
44,Eric Idle, Evidently not... 
45,Terry Jones," All right, I'll be round. "
46,Eric Idle," Oh, and Joseph... "
47,Terry Jones," Yes, Jacques? "
48,Eric Idle, You will... wash... won't you? 
49,Terry Jones," Yes, of course! "
0,Graham Chapman," His Royal Majesty, Louis XIV of France. "
1,Eric Idle," Your Majesty. It's a great privilege. Welcome to 
            our humble abode. "
2,Michael Palin, 
3,Eric Idle, 
4,Graham Chapman, Sir? 
5,Eric Idle, Claret for His Majesty please. 
6,Graham Chapman," There's a Mr. Bartlett outside again, sir. "
7,Eric Idle," Not now, I can't see him, we have the King of 
            France here. "
8,Graham Chapman," Yes, sir. "
9,Eric Idle," Your Majesty. You had a pleasant journey, I 
            trust? "
10,Michael Palin," Yes... yes, oh definitely... yes... yes. Oh aye, 
            aye. "
11,Eric Idle, You have come from Paris? 
12,Michael Palin, Where? 
13,Eric Idle, From Paris... you have traveled from Paris? 
14,Michael Palin," Oh yes, we've come from Paris... yes... yes, yes, 
            we've just come from... er... Paris... yes. "
15,Graham Chapman, Sir? 
16,Eric Idle," Yes, O'Toole? "
17,Graham Chapman," Which one is the claret, sir? "
18,Eric Idle, The claret is in the decanter. 
19,Graham Chapman, The wooden thing? 
20,Eric Idle," No no... the glass thing... the glass decanter 
            with the round glass stopper. "
21,Graham Chapman," Oh yes, behind the door. "
22,Eric Idle, No no... on the sideboard. 
23,Graham Chapman, The sideboard? 
24,Eric Idle," The sideboard... yes. Look... you go into the 
            salle a manger ... the dining room, right? - and the sideboard is on 
            your left, by the wall, beside the master's portrait. "
25,Graham Chapman," Ah! Above the mirror, sir? "
26,Eric Idle," No! No! The mirror is on the other side. It's 
            opposite the mirror. "
27,Graham Chapman," But that's the table, sir. "
28,Eric Idle," No... you don't go as far as the table. You go 
            into the room, right?... on your right is the door to the orangery, 
            straight ahead of you is the door to the library, and to your left 
            is the sideboard. "
29,Graham Chapman," Ah, yes, I see, sir... "
30,Eric Idle," And the claret is on top of the sideboard, to the 
            left. "
31,Graham Chapman, On the left. 
32,Eric Idle, Yes... 
33,Graham Chapman," As one looks at it, sir? "
34,Eric Idle, Yes. 
35,Graham Chapman," I see, sir, thank you. "
36,Eric Idle, O'Toole. 
37,Graham Chapman," Yes, sir. "
38,Eric Idle," Will you please tell Monsieur Joseph our guest is 
            here. "
39,Graham Chapman," Yes, sir. "
40,Eric Idle," I'm sorry about that, Your Majesty. "
41,Graham Chapman, 
42,Eric Idle," Not now, O'Toole! "
43,Michael Palin," Well... er... Mr. Montgolfier... let's not beat 
            around the bush ... my... dukes and I are very busy men. What we'd 
            like to do is see the plans of your proposed balloon... if that's at 
            all possible. "
44,Eric Idle," Certainly, Your Majesty... I have them here ready 
            prepared. "
45,Michael Palin," Oh, great .... then... what we would like to do ... 
            is er... to take them back wi'us for the Royal Archives of er... "
46,Michael Palin," France, aye. "
47,Eric Idle," Well, it is indeed a great honor Your Majesty, 
            that I cannot refuse. "
48,Michael Palin, Right! OK! Let's get 'em. 
49,Terry Jones, Just a moment! 
50,Eric Idle, Joseph! 
51,Terry Jones, 
52,Eric Idle, Joseph Are you out of your mind! 
53,Terry Jones," I've been looking it up in my bath. Louis XIV died 
            in 1717. It's now 1783! Answer me that! "
54,Michael Palin," Did I say Louis XIV? Oh, sorry, I meant Louis XV... 
            Louis XV. "
55,Terry Jones, He died in 1774! 
56,Michael Palin," All right, Louis XVI!... listen to me, smartarse, 
            when you're King of France,... you've got better things ,to do than 
            go around all day remembering your bloody number. "
57,Terry Jones, Aaaaaarh! 
58,Michael Palin, Right! You want to argue about numbers? 
59,Eric Idle," Er... no, no. "
60,Michael Palin," Right, well... lees get hold of the plans for the 
            Royal Archives. We've got to get back to... er... "
61,Michael Palin, Paris by tonight so get a move on.. 
62,Terry Jones, Aaaargh! Ow! Ooooohh! 
63,Graham Chapman," I got as far as the sideboard, sir... "
64,Terry Jones, Stop them... oh! Ah... oooooohh! 
65,Graham Chapman, 
66,Terry Jones," Stop... ow! Stop them, O'Toole for... oh! shit! 
            God's sake... stop them, they've got the plans! "
67,Michael Palin," Will Louis XVI get away with the Montgolfiers' 
            precious plans? Is sixteen years of work to be stolen by this 
            suspect sovereign? Is France really in the grip of a Glaswegian 
            monarch? Watch next week's episode of 'The Golden Age of 
            Ballooning'... Now! "
68,Graham Chapman," ... But now that the Government has 
            collapsed ... and shown itself incapable of providing any son of 
            unifying force, I feel we do need the stability and the breathing 
            space that a military presence would provide. "
69,Michael Palin, Lord Interest? 
70,Eric Idle," Oh yes... I agree that the army should take 
            over, but I think it should not interfere with the program of street 
            executions, which I feel have been the shot in the arm that the 
            British economy so desperately needed. "
71,Michael Palin," The Montgolfier brothers' plans did indeed turn 
            up... six months later, and a long way from Paris, at the court of 
            King George III of England. "
0,Eric Idle," ... Titty was very worried. Where could Mary be? 
            He looked everywhere. Under the stones and behind the bushes... and 
            Mr. Squirrel helped him by looking up in the trees, and Mr. Badger 
            helped him by looking under the ground... "
1,Eric Idle," ... and so, Your Majesty, we the Commons do herein 
            crave and beseech that... "
2,Graham Chapman, Enter! 
3,Terry Jones, Your Majesty... Louis XVIII is here! 
4,Graham Chapman, Who is Louis XVIII? 
5,Terry Jones," The King of France, Your Majesty! This is a 
            great moment to have, sir. "
6,Graham Chapman, There is no Louis XVIII. 
7,Terry Jones," He craves Your Majesty's pardon. He has had a 
            long journey here and miscounted... He is Louis XVII. "
8,Graham Chapman, Louis XVI is dead already? 
9,Terry Jones," Aaaaaaaaaaaaghh! Oh my God! Oh... ah... oh 
            Christ! "
10,Michael Palin, 
11,Graham Chapman, George III 
12,Michael Palin, George III Sorry. Where can we talk? 
13,Terry Jones," OH God! ... did you see that?... Oh!... 
            aaaargh! Oh dear! "
14,Graham Chapman," We shall have a state banquet at St James' 
            Palace! "
15,Michael Palin," No look, I can't hang about. It's take it or 
            leave... we got to get back to... er... "
16,Michael Palin," Paris, by tonight... "
17,Graham Chapman," Must you leave us, Louis? "
18,Michael Palin," I'd rather just sell the plans and nip off, Georgie 
            boy. "
19,Graham Chapman," All right... we will buy the plans... if you 
            will undertake to disengage your troops in America. "
20,Michael Palin, Do what? 
21,Graham Chapman," And, I shall give you £10,000 for the plans...
            "
22,Michael Palin," Ten thousand pounds! Right, well, we'll disengage 
            the, urn, you know... like you said - we'll disengage 'em... tell 
            you what, hen, I'll put a duke on to it... OK? Right! "
23,Terry Jones, 
24,Michael Palin," You asked for it, sonny. "
25,Terry Jones, You could have broken my bloody nose! 
26,Graham Chapman, North! Please! 
27,Terry Jones, You saw it! It was right on the bone. 
28,Graham Chapman," North! Will you send for the Duke of Portland 
            ... we have a financial matter to discuss. "
29,Terry Jones," Well, it really hurt. "
30,Michael Palin," No, look, I think it's better if you give the money 
            to us. We're going back. We've got a bag. "
31,Graham Chapman," No, no... don't worry, Louis. We shall talk to 
            your Monsieur Necker. "
32,Michael Palin," Ah! Well, actually, we'd rather you didn't... we've 
            been having a wee bit of trouble with him... you know what I mean?
            "
33,Graham Chapman," Monsieur Necker? The man who introduced so 
            many valuable reforms and who proved so popular despite his 
            opposition to Mirabeau's policy of issuing 'assignats'? "
34,Michael Palin," Er... aye, yeah... the trouble is he's been 
            drinking a bit recently ... you' know, fourteen lagers with his 
            breakfast... that sort of thing. "
35,Graham Chapman," Well... very well, Louis... "
36,Terry Jones, Just a moment! 
37,Michael Palin," Oh, Christ! "
38,Graham Chapman, What are you doing? 
39,Terry Jones," I am Joseph Montgolfier, the inventor of the fire 
            balloon. The man before you is an impostor! "
40,Graham Chapman, Ooh! I am not ... honestly! 
41,Terry Jones," No, not you, Your Majesty "
42,Michael Palin, I got it right! 
43,Terry Jones, I bet you took a few guesses. 
44,Michael Palin," Listen, you spotty sassenach pillock.. "
45,Terry Gilliam, 
46,Graham Chapman," Oh dear, I'm not supposed to go mad till 1800!
            "
47,Carol Cleveland," Joseph has been gone for six months now ... we 
            have heard nothing! "
48,Eric Idle, He can look after himself. 
49,Carol Cleveland," But he had only on a towel, you know. "
50,Eric Idle," Antoinette... from now on there is only one 
            Montgolfier brother. "
51,Carol Cleveland," But Louis XIV has the plans... you must wait 
            until Joseph returns. "
52,Eric Idle, 
53,Carol Cleveland, What do you mean? 
54,Eric Idle," We're supposed to be French, aren't we? "
55,Carol Cleveland," No, I mean what are the plans which Joseph 
            after is chasing? "
56,Eric Idle," Please, let me put it in a little way. "
57,Carol Cleveland," Oh, Jacques, ze plans! "
58,Eric Idle, I take it out if you don't like it. 
59,Eric Idle," Yes, O'Toole, it's always been there. "
60,Eric Idle," Thank you, O'Toole... "
61,Eric Idle, 
62,Eric Idle," Thank you, O'Toole. "
63,Eric Idle, Right!

2,Michael Palin," Well, it's very nice anyway. "

            thick-headed Saxon git! It's not a balloon! Balloons is for kiddy-winkies. 
            If you want to play with balloons, get outside. "
5,Terry Jones, Aaaaaaaaaghhh! 
6,Michael Palin, 
7,Eric Idle," I hear you are to name the balloon after 
            Bismarck? "
8,Graham Chapman, 
9,Eric Idle, Surely he gave you some money for it? 
10,Graham Chapman, Get outside! 
11,Michael Palin," Za... bag... lione... a sort of cream mouse... 
            mousse of Italian origin... "
12,Michael Palin," Ferdinand... that was a Minister of State you 
            just threw out of the balloon. "
13,Graham Chapman, It's not a balloon! It's an airship! 
14,Michael Palin," All right, I'm sorry. "
15,Graham Chapman, All right - go and have a look! 
16,Michael Palin, Zu... cchin... ni ... Italian... ma... flows... 
17,Terry Jones, 
18,Michael Palin, What? Prince Von Bulow? Here? 
19,Terry Jones, Ja! 
20,Michael Palin, Coming here? 
21,Terry Jones, No - he is here. 
22,Michael Palin, 
23,Terry Jones," He won't notice, Helmut. He's dead. "
24,Michael Palin, Dead? Here? 
25,Terry Jones, Ja. In our sitting room. 
26,Michael Palin," This is our sitting room, dear. "
27,Terry Jones," well, you know what I mean. "
28,Michael Palin, 
29,Terry Jones, Yes ... but it's a kind of sitting room. 
30,Michael Palin, 
31,Terry Jones, Look! 
32,Michael Palin, Which one is Von Bulow? 
33,Terry Jones, Here ... look! 
34,Michael Palin," Oh, ja ... and Admiral Tirpitz! "
35,Terry Jones, Ja. 
36,Michael Palin," And Von Muller... and Herr Reichner... and Hollweg 
            and Von Graunberg... "
37,Terry Jones," That isn't Graunberg - that's Graunberg... 
            das ist Moltke... "
38,Michael Palin, He's a lot older than I thought. 
39,Terry Jones," He's a clever man, ja. "
40,Michael Palin, ... and Zimmermann ... and Kimpte... 
41,Terry Jones," What shall we do, Helmut? "
42,Michael Palin, We must ring the Government. 
43,Terry Jones," This is the Government, Helmut. "
44,Michael Palin, Oh dear. 
45,Terry Jones," It is a great honor to have so many members 
            of the Government dead in our sitting room. "
46,Michael Palin, Drawing room. 
47,Terry Jones," Ja, well... "
48,Michael Palin," There are no members of the Government dead in our 
            sitting room. "
49,Terry Jones," Ja, you know what I mean. "
50,Michael Palin," Perhaps I should make a little speech or 
            something? "
51,Terry Jones," Not a speech, Helmut no... "
52,Michael Palin, Shall we make them a cup of tea? 
53,Terry Jones, It would be a waste of tea. 
54,Michael Palin," But we must do something - so many important 
            people in our drawing room - we must do something. "
55,Terry Jones, We could sort them out. 
56,Michael Palin, And make a little list. 
57,Terry Jones," Ja, ja. We could put the ministers for 
            internal affairs over against the wall, and those for foreign here 
            by the clock. "
58,Michael Palin, And we can sort them out alphabetically? 
59,Terry Jones," Nein, nein - just put the cleanest by the 
            door. "
60,Michael Palin, Ja. 
61,Terry Jones," No, no! That's Von Bulow! He must go over 
            here. "
62,Michael Palin, That is my reading chair. 
63,Terry Jones," He is the Reich Chancellor of Germany, 
            Helmut. "
64,Michael Palin," All right ... but I think he would have been 
            better up against the clock, you know. "
65,Terry Jones," No, he would not look nice under the clock.
            "
66,Michael Palin," I did not say under the clock. I said against the 
            clock. "
67,Terry Jones, Well then we could not see the clock! 
68,Michael Palin," We could put the Minister for Colonies under the 
            clock. He's small. "
69,Terry Jones," No. Colonies are internal affairs. He must go 
            against the wall. "
70,Michael Palin, Soon we shall be able to make a list. 
71,Terry Jones," Ja, is, wait a minute! ... Who's that by the 
            cat litter? "
72,Michael Palin, I don't know. I've never seen him before. 
73,Terry Jones," He is not a member of the Government. Get him 
            out of here. Put him in the drawing room. "
74,Michael Palin," He's in the drawing room, my dear. "
75,Terry Jones," Ja, well you know what I mean. "
76,Michael Palin, Put him in the sitting room. 
77,Terry Jones," Ja, in, the sitting room, it's all the same.
            "
78,Michael Palin," You can put him in the sitting room if he's in the 
            drawing room. "
0,Carol Cleveland," Yes this looks the sort of thing. May I just try it?
            "
1,Terry Gilliam," Certainly, madam. "
2,Carol Cleveland, Oh! Sorry! So sorry! 
3,Terry Gilliam," Is that on account, madam? "
4,Carol Cleveland, Yes. 
0,Eric Idle, Hello? Hello? 
1,Graham Chapman," Oh, I'm terribly sorry... "
2,Eric Idle," Oh I see, yes. "
3,Graham Chapman," I'm sorry sir, can I help you? "
4,Eric Idle," Yes, yes, as a matter of fact you can, actually I 
            was interested in . the possibility... of purchasing one of your ... 
            can I ask who you thought I was? "
5,Graham Chapman, What? 
6,Eric Idle," Who did you think I was... just then... when you 
            thought I was somebody. "
7,Graham Chapman," Oh, it's no one you'd know, sir. "
8,Eric Idle, Well I might know them. 
9,Graham Chapman," It's possible, obviously, but I think 
            it's really unlikely. "
10,Eric Idle," Well, I know quite a lot... "
11,Graham Chapman," I mean he's hardly likely to move in your 
            circles, sir... "
12,Eric Idle," Why, is he very rich? "
13,Graham Chapman," Oh, no, I didn't mean that, sir. "
14,Eric Idle, Is he a lord or something? 
15,Graham Chapman," Oh, no, not at all. "
16,Eric Idle," Well look, this is very easy to settle. What is his 
            name?. "
17,Graham Chapman, What? 
18,Eric Idle, What is his name? 
19,Graham Chapman, Well... er... 
20,Eric Idle, Yes? 
21,Graham Chapman, Michael Ellis. 
22,Eric Idle, Who? 
23,Graham Chapman, Michael Ellis. 
24,Eric Idle, I see. 
25,Graham Chapman," Do you know him, sir? "
26,Eric Idle, Er ... Michael Ellis. Michael Ellis... 
27,Graham Chapman, You don't 
28,Eric Idle," Well, I don't remember the name. "
29,Graham Chapman," I think you would remember him, sir. "
30,Eric Idle, Why do you say that? 
31,Graham Chapman," Well, would you remember a man six foot 
            nine inches high, fortyish, and he's got a long scar from here to 
            here and absolutely no nose? "
32,Eric Idle," ... oh, I think I do remember somebody like that...
            "
33,Graham Chapman," Well, that's not Michael Ellis. "
34,Eric Idle, What? 
35,Graham Chapman," He's a small man about this high with a 
            high-pitched voice. "
36,Eric Idle," Right, I'm not going to buy an ant from you now.
            "
37,Graham Chapman, 
38,Eric Idle," No. You've not been properly trained. I demand 
            another assistant. "
39,Graham Chapman," Oh, no, come on... please... "
40,Eric Idle," No, I want another assistant. "
41,Graham Chapman, All right! I'll get another assistant. 
42,Eric Idle, Thank you. 
43,Graham Chapman, 
44,Eric Idle," No, I want a different assistant. "
45,Graham Chapman," I am sir, I'm Mr. Abanazar, sir. "
46,Eric Idle, Don't be silly. 
47,Graham Chapman, 
48,Eric Idle, No! I want another assistant. 
49,Graham Chapman," Oh, no, come on, please... "
50,Eric Idle," If you don't give me another assistant.,. "
51,Graham Chapman," No, no, I'll be very good, sir, really.
            "
52,Eric Idle, Right I'm going! 
53,Graham Chapman," No, no, please... "
54,Michael Palin, Woooooo ....ooooooo... 
55,Graham Chapman, It's not him! 
56,Eric Idle, 
57,Graham Chapman," Oh please, give him a chance! "
58,Eric Idle, No! 
59,Michael Palin, 
60,Eric Idle," Oh no, come on, don't try that! "
61,Michael Palin," I'm sorry, sir... try what? "
62,Eric Idle, You know perfectly well what I mean. 
63,Michael Palin," I'm afraid I don't, sir. "
64,Eric Idle," You were down behind there with a silly mask on 
            going wooo-ooo... "
65,Michael Palin," I don't think I was, sir. "
66,Eric Idle," All right, get the manager. "
67,Michael Palin," There seems to have been some sort of 
            misunderstanding, sir. "
68,Eric Idle, Manager! 
69,Graham Chapman," This is the manager, sir. "
70,Eric Idle, What? 
71,Michael Palin, 
72,Eric Idle, Manager! 
73,Michael Palin," It's a smashing store this, I can't 
            recommend it too highly, well-lit, rat-free. It's a joy to manage. 
            Oh yes, the freshest haddock in London, second floor, third floor 
            Ribena, ants here, television and flame throwers over there, behind 
            them our dinner-wagon exhibition closes at six... "
74,Graham Chapman, 
75,Terry Jones," Yes, sir? Can I help you, sir? "
76,Eric Idle, 
77,Terry Jones," I'm sorry to hear that, sir, which ones? "
78,Eric Idle," Well, they're hiding now. "
79,Terry Jones, Sir? 
80,Eric Idle," They're hiding, down there behind the counter. "
81,Terry Jones," I see, sir. "
82,Eric Idle," They must have crawled through here, and made their 
            escape through 'Soft Toys'. "
83,Terry Jones," Yes, of course. "
84,Eric Idle," They were wearing masks and making silly noises and 
            one of them pretended to be the manager. He spoke like this.. "
85,Terry Jones," Ah! I think I've got it, sir, I think I've 
            got it! Its rag week. "
86,Eric Idle, Rag week? 
87,Terry Jones," Yes, you know, for charity, sir. "
88,Eric Idle, Oh! I see. Some local college or university? 
89,Terry Jones," No, no it's the store's rag week. "
90,Eric Idle, The store's rag week? 
91,Terry Jones," Yes. The senior staff don't join in much - 
            it's for the trainees really... "
92,Eric Idle, It's not very good for business is it? 
93,Terry Jones," Oh, It's for charity, sir. People are 
            awfully good about it, you know. "
94,Eric Idle," Yes, yes, of course. "
95,Terry Jones," Right, sir, I'll get you a senior assistant 
            - ants, was it? "
96,Eric Idle," Yes, please. "
97,Terry Jones, 
98,Eric Idle, I don't want him! 
99,Graham Chapman, Oh please! Give me a chance! 
100,Eric Idle, No! 
101,Terry Jones, All right - Mr. Hartford! 
102,Michael Palin," Yes - good morning, sir - can I help you? "
103,Eric Idle," Yes, please, I'm interested in buying an ant. "
104,Michael Palin," Ah yes - and what price were you thinking of 
            paying, sir? "
105,Eric Idle," Oh, well, I hadn't actually got as far as that. "
106,Michael Palin," Well sir, they start about half a p. but they 
            can go as high as three p. or even three and a half p. for a 
            champion - inflation I'm afraid... "
107,Eric Idle," Well, I should think one about one and a half p., 
            please. "
108,Michael Palin," Ah yes, well you should get a very serviceable 
            little animal for that, sir. Quite frankly the half pence ones are a 
            bit on the mangy side ... What length was sir thinking of?. "
109,Eric Idle, Oh ... medium? 
110,Michael Palin," Medium. Medium. Here we are, sir. "
111,Eric Idle, That's a nice one. 
112,Michael Palin," Lees see how you get on with him, eh? "
113,Eric Idle, What do you feed them on? 
114,Michael Palin, Blancmange. 
115,Eric Idle, Blancmange? 
116,Michael Palin," I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. No, you 
            don't feed them at all. "
117,Eric Idle," Well, what do they live on? "
118,Michael Palin, They don't. They die. 
119,Eric Idle, They die? 
120,Michael Palin," Well of course they do, if you don't feed them.
            "
121,Eric Idle, I don't understand. 
122,Michael Palin," You let them die, then you buy another one. It's 
            much cheaper than feeding them and that way you have a constant 
            variety of little companions. "
123,Eric Idle," Oh, I see. "
124,Michael Palin, That's the advantage of owning an ant. 
125,Eric Idle," Right, well I'll take this one. Oh dear, I've 
            dropped it... "
126,Michael Palin, Never mind. Here's another one. 
127,Eric Idle, Is there anything else I'll need? 
128,Michael Palin," Yes, sir - you'll need an ant house. "
129,Eric Idle, Won't it get out of there? 
130,Michael Palin, Yes. 
131,Eric Idle, Well what's the point of having the cage? 
132,Michael Palin," Well, none at all really. And then some pieces 
            of cage furniture which will keep him entertained. "
133,Eric Idle, Will he live long enough? 
134,Michael Palin," Not really, no, but it's best to have one just 
            in case, and here's a two-way radio he can play with... and of 
            course you'll need the book. "
135,Eric Idle, The book? 
136,Michael Palin," Yes, the book on ants. "
137,Eric Idle, 
138,Michael Palin," So, sir, that is, if I may say so, one hundred 
            and eighty-four pounds one and a half p., sir. "
139,Eric Idle, Will you take a check? 
140,Michael Palin," Yes, sir, if you don't mind leaving a 
            blood-sample, and a piece of skin off the back of the scalp just 
            here, sir ... "
141,Eric Idle," Oh, well I think I'll put it on account. "
142,Michael Palin," I should, sir... much less painful Anyway sir, 
            you know what they say about an ant. A friend for life, eh? Well, a 
            friend for its life anyway... "
143,Eric Idle, Thanks very much indeed. 
144,Michael Palin," Not at all, thank you, Mr. Ellis. "
145,Graham Chapman, Sssssshh! 
146,Eric Idle, What did you say? 
147,Michael Palin," I said thank you, Mr. Ellis... "
148,Graham Chapman, It's not him. 
149,Michael Palin, Oh! 
150,Eric Idle, Why did you say I was Mr. Ellis? 
151,Michael Palin, 
152,Graham Chapman," No, he didn't say that. "
153,Eric Idle," Yes he did. I heard him say 'Thank you, Mr. Ellis'.
            "
154,Graham Chapman," Oh, no, no - he said 'I'm jealous'. "
155,Eric Idle, What? 
156,Graham Chapman," I'm jealous of your ant. Goodbye. 
            Goodbye. "
157,Eric Idle, 
0,Terry Jones, What have you got now? 
1,Eric Idle," I bought an ant, mother. "
2,Terry Jones," What d'you want one of them for! I'm not going to 
            clean it out. You said you'd clean the tiger out, but do you? No, I 
            suppose you've lost interest in it now. Now it'll be ant ant ant for 
            a couple of days, then all of a sudden, 'oh, mum, I've bought a 
            sloth' or some other odd-toed ungulate like a tapir. "
3,Eric Idle," It's really different this time, mum. I'm really 
            going to look after this ant. "
4,Terry Jones," That's what you said about the sperm whale... now 
            your papa's having to use it as a garage. "
5,Eric Idle," Well, you didn't feed it properly. "
6,Terry Jones," Where are we going to get forty-four tons of 
            plankton from every morning? Your papa was dead vexed about that. 
            They thought he was mad in the dell. "
7,Eric Idle, Well at least he's got a free garage. 
8,Terry Jones," That's no good to him... his Hillman smells all 
            fishy. "
9,Eric Idle, Are you giving that tiger drugs? 
10,Terry Jones, 'Course I'm giving it drugs! 
11,Eric Idle, It's illegal. 
12,Terry Jones, You try telling that to the tiger. 
13,Eric Idle, I think it's dangerous. 
14,Terry Jones," Listen ... before he started fixing, he used to 
            get through four Jehovah's wimesses a day. And he used to eat all of 
            them, except the pamphlets. "
15,Eric Idle, Well he's not dim. 
16,Terry Jones, All right! 
17,Eric Idle," Well, I'm going to watch one of the televisions... 
            come on Marcus. "
18,Terry Jones, Michael's been on the phone all day for you. 
19,Eric Idle, Michel? 
20,Terry Jones," You know, Michael... Michael. Michael Ellis. He's 
            been on the phone all day ... he came round twice. "
21,Eric Idle, What did he look like? 
22,Terry Jones," Oh, I didn't see him. The orange-rumped agouti 
            answered the door. Only useful animal you ever bought, that. "
23,Eric Idle, Where is he now? 
24,Terry Jones," He's upstairs forging prescriptions for the 
            sodding tiger! "
25,Eric Idle," No, no, where is Michael Ellis now? "
26,Terry Jones," Oh, I don't know.., he said it wasn't important, 
            anyway... all right, here I come. "
0,Michael Palin, 
1,Eric Idle," Ah! We're in luck again, Marcus. "
2,Michael Palin," Hello formicidophiles! Before the blood and guts 
            that you're waiting to see, let's have a look at the anatomy of the 
            little ant. "
3,Terry Jones," The body of the ant is divided into 
            three sections... "
4,Eric Idle," I didn't know ants had six legs, Marcus! "
5,Terry Jones," Well I can assure you they do, Mr. Ellis. "
6,Eric Idle," Hey! You've got two legs missing! And that's a 
            false feeler Marcus! Blimey! "
7,Eric Idle," I'm taking this ant back, mother - he's got two 
            legs missing. "
8,Terry Jones," Hey! Mrs. McWong's been on the phone! The polar 
            bear's been in her garden again. "
9,Eric Idle," Well I'll get it on the way back from the store.
            "
10,Terry Jones, Well mind you do - his droppings are enormous. 
0,Eric Idle," stands there with his ant in his hand. There are 
            also two ladies in German national costume. The lift lady, who has a 
            wall-eye, a wooden leg, a tooth-brace, a hearing aid, a hilt-up 
            shoe, a neck-brace, and a hook is reciting.)"
1,Michael Palin," Second floor ... stationery, leather goods, 
            tribal head injuries, cricket bats, film stars, dolphinafiums. "
2,Michael Palin," Third floor ... cosmetics, books, Irish 
            massage, tribal head'. gear, ants.. "
3,Eric Idle," Oh, where do I go to complain? "
4,Michael Palin," Straight on, then left, then fight past the 
            thing, then, up the little stairs, then right by where it's gone all 
            soft, then down the wobbly bit, past the nail, past the brown stain 
            on the wall to your fight and it's the door marked exit straight 
            ahead of you on the left. "
5,Eric Idle, Thank you. 
6,Michael Palin, 
7,Eric Idle, I don't want you. 
8,Graham Chapman, 
9,Eric Idle, No! I'm not going to tell you. 
10,Graham Chapman," Something missing in the leg department?
            "
11,Terry Jones," Can I help you, sir? "
12,Eric Idle, No! No! No! No! 
13,Terry Jones," Oh, it's all right, sir, it's for the sack race 
            later on. "
14,Eric Idle," No, no, no, I want to speak to the General Manager, 
            I want to complain. "
15,Terry Jones," Oh, well you want the Toupee Hall in that case, 
            sir. "
16,Eric Idle, The what? 
17,Terry Jones," The Toupee Hall, Mr. Ellis. "
18,Eric Idle, 
19,Michael Palin, Sorry? 
20,Eric Idle, The Toupee Hall. 
21,Michael Palin, The what? 
22,Eric Idle, The Toupee Hall. 
23,Michael Palin," Oh, the Toupee Hall "
24,Graham Chapman, Toupees? 
25,Michael Palin, This gentleman wants one. 
26,Graham Chapman, 
27,Eric Idle," Well, no, actually... "
28,Graham Chapman, I think they're in surgical appliances now. 
29,Michael Palin," That's fight, yes, you go left at artificial 
            limbs and hearing aids, right at dentures and it's on your left just 
            by glass eyes. It doesn't say toupees to avoid embarrassing people, 
            but you can smell 'em. "
30,Eric Idle, Thank you. 
31,Michael Palin, 
0,Graham Chapman," Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, it's so 
            nice to see such a large turnout this afternoon. And I'd like to 
            start off by welcoming our guest speakers for this afternoon,... Mr. 
            Wadsworth... "
1,Terry Jones, Wordsworth! 
2,Graham Chapman," Sorry, Wordsworth... Mr. John Koots, and Percy 
            Bysshe. "
3,Terry Gilliam, Shelley! 
4,Graham Chapman," Just a little one, medium dry, "
5,Graham Chapman, Tennis ball. 
6,Graham Chapman," Sorry - Alfred Lord, who is evidently Lord 
            Tennisball's son. And to start off I'm going to ask Mr. Wadsworth to 
            read his latest offering, a little pram entitled 'I wandered lonely 
            as a crab' and it's all about ants. "
7,Terry Jones,
8,Graham Chapman," Thank you, thank you, Mr. Bradlaugh. Now, 'Mr. 
            Bysshe. "
9,Terry Gilliam, Shelley. 
10,Graham Chapman, Oh... 
11,Terry Gilliam, 
12,Graham Chapman," Thank you Mr. Amontillado. I'd like to ask one 
            or two of you at the back not to soil the carpet, there is a 
            restroom upstairs if you find the poems too exciting "
13,Eric Idle, 
14,Graham Chapman," Mr. Keats, Mr. Keats, please leave immediately.
            "
15,Eric Idle," It's true. Don't you see. It's true. It happens.
            "
16,Graham Chapman, 
0,Terry Jones," Don't worry, sir, you're among friends 
            now, sir. "
1,Eric Idle," Well, you all are, aren't you? "
2,Michael Palin, Have you got one? 
3,Graham Chapman," Yes, but I didn't know... "
4,Terry Jones," I didn't realize that you two.., I thought 
            it was me, "
5,Graham Chapman," Yes, I thought it was me, "
6,Michael Palin, So did I. 
7,Eric Idle," Actually, I only came in here to ask where the 
            manager's office was. "
8,Terry Jones," Just a minute - someone told you we all 
            had toupees? "
9,Eric Idle, No. 
10,Graham Chapman, Oh yeah? 
11,Michael Palin, How did you know? 
12,Eric Idle," Well ... it's pretty obvious, isn't it? "
13,Graham Chapman," What do you mean obvious! His is undetectable.
            "
14,Eric Idle," Well, it's a different color, for a start. "
15,Michael Palin, Is it? 
16,Graham Chapman, Course it isn't! 
17,Eric Idle," And it doesn't fit in with the rest of his hair... 
            it sort of sticks up in the middle. "
18,Michael Palin, It's better than yours. 
19,Graham Chapman, Yes. 
20,Eric Idle, I'm not wearing one. 
21,Terry Jones," Oh, I see, you haven't got one. "
22,Graham Chapman, Why did you come in here then? 
23,Eric Idle, They told me to find the manager's office here. 
24,Michael Palin," Oh no, not again. "
25,Graham Chapman," That's a bit lame, isn't it... "
26,Eric Idle, It's the truth! 
27,Michael Palin," Yeah, look at it. Where did you get that, Mac 
            Fishcries? "
28,Terry Jones," Dreadful, isn't it? "
29,Graham Chapman, Nylon? 
30,Eric Idle," It's not, it's real look. "
31,Graham Chapman," Come on, get if off. "
32,Eric Idle, Get away. 
33,Terry Jones," Look, do you want a proper one? "
34,Eric Idle," No, I don't need one. "
35,Michael Palin, There's no need to be ashamed. 
36,Graham Chapman, We've all owned up. 
37,Eric Idle, I'm not wearing one. 
38,Terry Jones," Don't you see... this is something you've 
            got to come to terms with. "
39,Eric Idle," I am not wearing a toupee! They just told me to 
            come in here to find the manager's office, to complain about my ant!
            "
40,Graham Chapman," Pathetic, isn't it. "
41,Michael Palin, Complain about an ant? 
42,Terry Jones, This is for your own good. 
0,Michael Palin, 
1,Carol Cleveland," You see! There ought to be a safety catch on it, I 
            mean ... ohhhh! "
2,Michael Palin," Yes, madam. I'll speak to the makers 
            personally, all right. "
3,Carol Cleveland, Would you? It would put my mind at ease. 
4,Carol Cleveland, Sorry... 
5,Michael Palin, Next? 
6,Terry Gilliam, He's still molesting her. 
7,Michael Palin," Yes, yes, I'll see to you in a moment, 
            sir. "
8,Graham Chapman, I've got a complaint to make. 
9,Michael Palin," Do take a seat. I'm sorry it's on 
            fire. "
10,Graham Chapman," Oh, not at all. "
11,Michael Palin, Where were you out east? 
12,Graham Chapman," Oh, Norway ... Sweden ... places like 
            that... oh I'm awfully sorry, my suit seems to keep catching fire.
            "
13,Michael Palin, Extinguisher? 
14,Graham Chapman," Oh no, thank you, I think we'd better let 
            it run its course. I was just thinking... Norway is not very east, 
            is it? I should have said when I was out north. "
15,Michael Palin, Are there many fires in Norway? 
16,Graham Chapman," Good Lord yes. The place is a constant 
            blaze. Wooden buildings, d'you know. I lost my wife in Norway. "
17,Michael Palin, I am sorry to hear that. 
18,Graham Chapman," Why, did you know her? "
19,Michael Palin," No, I meant... "
20,Graham Chapman," Oh I see. No, she wasn't a favorite of 
            mine. We were out strolling across a fiord one day when one of the 
            local matadors came out of his tree house and flung a lot of old 
            scimitars and guillotines out that he'd got cluttering up his wine 
            cellar and apparently rather a large proportion of them landed on my 
            wife causing her to snuff it without much more ado. "
21,Michael Palin," Yes, yes - well look... "
22,Eric Idle, What a rotten ending.
0,Terry Jones," Well it is one of our cheapest, sir. "
1,Eric Idle, What else have you got? 
2,Terry Jones," Well, there's the long slow pull-out, sir, you 
            know, the camera tracks back and back and mixes... "
3,Eric Idle," No, have you got anything more exciting? "
4,Terry Jones, How about a chase? 
5,Eric Idle," Oh, no, no, no. "
6,Terry Jones, Walking into the sunset? 
7,Eric Idle, What's that one? 
8,Terry Jones," You know ... two lone figures silhouetted 
            against the dying rays of the setting sun. The music swells, you've 
            got a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye... "
9,Eric Idle, Oh no. 
10,Terry Jones," Oh, pity, I rather like that one... "
11,Eric Idle," They're all a bit off the point, you see. "
12,Terry Jones," Well there is one that ties up the whole 
            Michael Ellis thing, but.... "
13,Eric Idle, But what... ? 
14,Terry Jones," Oh, no, nothing, nothing... "
15,Eric Idle," Look, who is this Michael Ellis? "
16,Terry Jones," How about a happy ending, sir? "
17,Carol Cleveland, Oh Chris! Thank God you're safe. 
18,Terry Jones," No, you wouldn't want that, would you. "
19,Eric Idle, Why wouldn't I want that? 
20,Terry Jones," What about summing up from the panel? That's 
            cheap. You know - the big match experts. "
21,Michael Palin," Yes. It was quite a good show. I think 
            that the Michael Ellis character was a little overdone. "
22,Eric Idle," Well, I don't agree with that, Malcolm, 
            quite frankly the only bit I liked was this bit with me in it now.
            "
23,Terry Jones, No? Slow fade? 
24,Eric Idle, Nnnn... no. 
25,Terry Jones," Well, how about a sudden ending? "
0,Michael Palin," Taking life as it comes, sharing the good 
            things and the bad things, finding laughter and fun wherever they go 
            -- it is with these two happy-go-lucky rogues that our story begins.
            "
1,Eric Idle, Che cosa è lo succiacatori do polli? 
2,Michael Palin," Yes! Tonight we examine the career of Gino 
            Agnelli! The man who started from nothing to build up one of the 
            greatest firms in Europe. "
0,Terry Jones," Morning, squadron leader. "
1,Eric Idle,"  What-ho, Squiffy. "
2,Terry Jones," >How was it? 
            "
3,Eric Idle," Top hole. Bally Jerry pranged his kite right in the how's your 
            father. Hairy blighter, dicky-birdied, feathered back on his 
            Sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harper's and caught 
            his can in the Bertie."
4,Terry Jones," Er, I'm afraid I don't quite follow you, squadron leader."
5,Eric Idle," It's perfectly ordinary banter, Squiffy. Bally Jerry ... 
            pranged his kite right in the how's yer father ... hairy blighter, 
            dicky-birdied, feathered back on his Sammy, took a waspy, flipped 
            over on his Betty Harper's and caught his can in the Bertie."
6,Terry Jones," No, I'm just not understanding banter at all well today. Give 
            us it slower."
7,Eric Idle," Banter's not the same if you say it slower, Squiffy."
8,Terry Jones," Hold on, then. "
9,Graham Chapman, Yes!
10,Terry Jones," Bend an ear to the squadron leader's banter for a sec, would 
            you?"
11,Graham Chapman, Can do.
12,Terry Jones, Jolly good.
13,Graham Chapman, Fire away.
14,Eric Idle, 
15,Graham Chapman," ... No, don't understand that banter at all."
16,Eric Idle," Something up with my banter, chaps? "
17,Michael Palin," Bunch of monkeys on your ceiling, sir! Grab your egg and fours 
            and let's get the bacon delivered. "
18,Graham Chapman, Do you understand that?
19,Eric Idle," No, didn't get a word of it."
20,Graham Chapman," Sorry old man, we don't understand your banter."
21,Michael Palin," You know ... bally ten-penny ones dropping in the custard ...
            "
22,Graham Chapman," No, no ... sorry."
23,Terry Jones," Say it a bit slower, old chap."
24,Michael Palin," Slower banter, sir?"
25,Graham Chapman, Ra-ther!
26,Michael Palin, Um ... sausage squad up the blue end!
27,Eric Idle," No, still don't get it."
28,Michael Palin, Um ... cabbage crates coming over the briny?
29,Eric Idle, No.
30,Terry Jones," No, no ... "
31,Michael Palin," But by then it was too late. The first cabbage crates hit 
            London by July 7th. That was just the beginning... "
0,Graham Chapman," Five shillings a dozen? That's ordinary cabbages, 
            is it? And what about the bombs? Good Lord, they are expensive!"
1,Eric Idle, Sir!
2,Graham Chapman," Yes, what is it?"
3,Eric Idle," News from the Western Front, sir."
4,Graham Chapman, Yes ... ?
5,Eric Idle," Big enemy attack at dawn, sir ..."
6,Graham Chapman, Yes ... ?
7,Eric Idle," Well, the enemy were all wearing little silver 
            halos, sir ... and ... they had fairy wands with big stars on the 
            end ... and ..."
8,Graham Chapman, They what ... ?
9,Eric Idle," .. and ... they had spiders in matchboxes, sir."
10,Graham Chapman, 
11,Eric Idle," Well, they were jolly interested, sir. Some of 
            them ... I think it was the 4th Armored Brigade, sir, they ... well, 
            they went and had a look at the spiders, sir."
12,Graham Chapman," Oh my God! All right, thank you, Shirley."
13,Eric Idle, Sir!
14,Graham Chapman, 
15,Graham Chapman, Bastards ...
16,Graham Chapman," First they drop cabbages instead of decent bombs 
            ..."
17,Eric Idle," The crates were probably quite expensive, sir."
18,Graham Chapman," Quiet, critic! And now they're doing very silly 
            things in one of the most vital areas of the war!"
19,Graham Chapman," What are we going to do, Shirley?"
20,Graham Chapman," Well, we've got to act fast before it saps 
            morale. We're going to show these Chinese ..."
21,Graham Chapman," These Germans ... we're going to show them that 
            no British soldier will descend to their level. Anyone found 
            trivializing this war will face the supreme penalty that military 
            law can provide. "
0,Terry Jones," Sapper Walters, you stand before this 
            court accused of carrying out the war by other than warlike means -- 
            to wit, that you did on April 16th, 1942, dress up as a bag of 
            dainties, flick wet towels at the enemy during an important 
            offensive ..."
1,Eric Idle," Well, sir ..."
2,Terry Jones," Shut up! Colonel Fawcett for the 
            prosecution ..."
3,Michael Palin," Sir, we all know ..."
4,Terry Jones, Shut up!
5,Michael Palin, I'm sorry?
6,Terry Jones, Carry on.
7,Michael Palin," Sir, we all know the facts of this case; that 
            Sapper Walters, being in possession of expensive military equipment, 
            to wit one Lee Enfield .303 rifle and 72 round of ammunition, valued 
            at a hundred and forty pounds three shillings and sixpence, chose 
            instead to use wet towels to take an enemy command post in the area 
            of Basingstoke ..."
8,Terry Jones, Basingstoke? Basingstoke in Hampshire?
9,Michael Palin," No, no, no, sir, no."
10,Terry Jones," I see, carry on."
11,Michael Palin, The result of his action was that the enemy ...
12,Terry Jones, Basingstoke where?
13,Michael Palin," Basingstoke Westphalia, sir."
14,Terry Jones, Oh I see. Carry on.
15,Michael Palin," The result of Sapper Walters's action was that 
            the enemy received wet patches upon their trousers and in some cases 
            small red strawberry marks upon their thighs ..."
16,Terry Jones," I didn't know there was a Basingstoke 
            in Westphalia."
17,Michael Palin, 
18,Terry Jones, What map?
19,Michael Palin, 
20,Terry Jones," Well, I've certainly never heard of 
            Basingstoke in Westphalia. "
21,Michael Palin, 
22,Terry Jones, What ... Southhampton in Westphalia?
23,Michael Palin," Yes sir ... bricks ... clothing. Nearby are 
            remains of Basing House, burned down by Cromwell's cavalry in 1645 
            ..."
24,Terry Jones, Who compiled this map?
25,Michael Palin," Cole Porter, sir."
26,Terry Jones, 
27,Michael Palin," No, alas not, sir ... this was Cole Porter who 
            wrote `Anything Goes'. Sir, I shall seek to prove that the man 
            before this court ..."
28,Terry Jones, That's the same one! 
29,Michael Palin," I beg your pardon, sir?"
30,Terry Jones, 
31,Michael Palin," No, this one's different, sir."
32,Terry Jones, How does it go?
33,Michael Palin," What, sir?"
34,Terry Jones, How does your `Anything Goes' go?
35,Eric Idle, Can I go home now?
36,Terry Jones, Shut up! 
37,Michael Palin," Sir, really, this is rather ..."
38,Terry Jones," Come on, how does your `Anything Goes' 
            go?"
39,Michael Palin, 
40,Terry Jones," No, that's not it ... carry on."
41,Michael Palin," With respect sir, I shall seek to prove that the 
            man before you in the dock being in the possession of the following: 
            one pair of army boots, value three pounds seven and six, one pair 
            of serge trousers, value two pounds three and six, one pair of 
            gaiters value sixty-eight pounds ten shillings, one ..."
42,Terry Jones," Sixty-eight pounds ten shillings for a 
            pair of gaiters?"
43,Michael Palin, 
44,Terry Jones, Special gaiters?
45,Michael Palin," Yes, sir, they were made in France. One beret 
            costing fourteen shillings, one pair of ..."
46,Terry Jones, What was special about them?
47,Michael Palin, Oh ... 
48,Terry Jones," Why was the accused wearing special 
            gaiters?"
49,Michael Palin, 
50,Terry Jones," Why did they present him with a special 
            pair of gaiters?"
51,Michael Palin," Sir, it seems to me totally irrelevant to the 
            case whether the gaiters were presented to him or not, sir."
52,Terry Jones," I think the court will be able to judge 
            that for themselves. I want to know why the regiment presented the 
            accused with a special pair of gaiters."
53,Michael Palin, 
54,Terry Jones, What things?
55,Michael Palin, 
56,Terry Jones, Oblige them?
57,Michael Palin," Yes, sir. The total value of the uniform ..."
58,Terry Jones, How did he oblige them?
59,Michael Palin, What sir?
60,Terry Jones, How did he oblige them?
61,Michael Palin, 
62,Terry Jones, Did he touch them at all?
63,Michael Palin, Sir! I submit that this is totally irrelevant.
64,Terry Jones, I want to know how he made them happy.
65,Michael Palin, 
66,Terry Jones, 
67,Eric Idle, 
68,Terry Jones, Yes. What have you got to say?
69,Eric Idle," What can I say? I mean, how can I encapsulate in 
            mere words my scorn for any military solution? The futility of 
            modern warfare? And the hypocrisy by which contemporary government 
            applies one standard to violence within the community and another to 
            violence perpetrated by one community upon another?"
70,Terry Gilliam," I'm sorry, but my client has become 
            pretentious. I will say in his defense that he has suffered ..."
71,Michael Palin, Sir! We haven't finished the prosecution!
72,Terry Jones," Shut up! I'm in charge of this court.
            "
0,Michael Palin, Yes! Coming to this cinema soon! 
1,Michael Palin," When the pilot, Jennifer "
2,Michael Palin, Coming to your cinema soon! 
0,Graham Chapman, Bloody repeats! 
1,Terry Jones," Yes, repeats or war films. It really 
            makes you want to micturate."
2,Graham Chapman," People on television treat the general 
            public like idiots. "
3,Terry Jones, Well we are idiots.
4,Graham Chapman, Oh no we are not!
5,Terry Jones, Well I am.
6,Graham Chapman, How do you know you're an idiot?
7,Terry Jones," Oh, I can show you!"
8,Graham Chapman, How?
9,Terry Jones, Look! 
0,Terry Jones," You see the public are idiots 
              ... "
1,Graham Chapman," At last they done been put on 
              something interesting. "
2,Terry Jones," Oh, most interesting."
3,Eric Idle, 
4,Terry Jones," I'm sorry ... we just can't give you a 
              bigger budget. "
5,Michael Palin, Budgie? 
6,Eric Idle, 
7,Terry Jones," We're not the only slice of the cake, 
              you know. "
8,Graham Chapman," Wouldn't mind a slice of cake. 
              Nice chocolate cake ... delicious ... "
9,Michael Palin," I had a budgie once you know, amusing 
              little chap, used to stick his head in a bell ... what was his 
              name, now ... Joey? ... Xerxes? ... "
10,Eric Idle, We could repeat them ... 
11,Graham Chapman, Re-heat them? 
12,Eric Idle," No, repeat them ... "
13,Graham Chapman," You don't re-heat cakes. Not chocolate 
              cakes. "
14,Terry Jones," What, repeat the cakes? "
15,Michael Palin," Mr. Heath, that was the name of the 
              budgie. "
16,Terry Jones, 
17,Eric Idle, Damn. Blast.
18,Eric Idle," I've got it. We can retitle the repeats.
              "
19,Michael Palin, What ... give them different names? 
20,Terry Jones, Wouldn't that mean retitling them? 
21,Graham Chapman, Brilliant! 
22,Terry Jones," Right -- all we need is new titles. And 
              they must be damned new! "
23,Michael Palin, How about `Dad's Navy'? 
24,Terry Jones," Mm, good, good. "
25,Eric Idle, `Up Your Mother Next Door.' 
26,Terry Jones, Even better ... 
27,Graham Chapman, `Doctor At Bee'! 
28,Terry Jones, What?
29,Eric Idle, Someone's knocking at the door. 
30,Terry Jones," Quite like it -- bit long, though, I 
              think. "
31,Graham Chapman, Far too long. 
32,Michael Palin, `I Married Lucy.' 
33,Terry Jones, Hasn't that been done? 
34,Michael Palin," Oh, yes, a long time ago, though, they'd 
              never remember it. "
35,Graham Chapman, `Doctor at Three'! 
36,Terry Jones, What?
37,Eric Idle," I think someone's knocking at the door.
              "
38,Terry Jones, That's even longer! 
39,Michael Palin, `I Married A Tree.' 
40,Terry Jones, `And Mother Makes Tree.' 
41,Graham Chapman, `Doctor At Cake'!
42,Eric Idle," Look! I'm not absolutely certain, but, 
              well I do rather get the impression that there is someone actually 
              knocking on the door at this very moment. "
43,Terry Jones," That's ridiculous. Half the program 
              gone. Stop lengthening it! "
44,Graham Chapman, 
45,Michael Palin, 
46,Graham Chapman," Prefer a cake ... specially chocky cake 
              ..."
47,Terry Gilliam, 
48,Terry Jones," No, no. You can't say `sodding' on the 
              television."
49,Terry Jones, You're supposed to knock! 
50,Terry Gilliam," Sorry, sir, but there's trouble at studio 
              five! "
51,Michael Palin," You're in security, aren't you? "
52,Terry Gilliam," Yes, sir. "
53,Michael Palin, 
54,Terry Gilliam," Sir! It's the World War series in studio 
              five -- they're not taking it seriously any more. "
55,Eric Idle," You're not allowed to suggest program 
              titles! "
56,Terry Gilliam, 
57,Terry Gilliam, Ow! Mind me war wound! 
58,Terry Jones, That's it! Very good title!
0,Graham Chapman, I say ...
1,Carol Cleveland," Yes, daddy?"
2,Graham Chapman, Croquet hoops look damn pretty this afternoon.
3,Carol Cleveland, Frightfully damn pretty.
4,Eric Idle, They're coming along awfully well this year.
5,Graham Chapman," Yes, better than your Aunt Lavinia's croquet 
            hoops."
6,Carol Cleveland, Ugh! -- dreadful tin things.
7,Eric Idle, I did tell her to stick to wood.
8,Graham Chapman," Yes, you can't beat wood ... Gorn!"
9,Eric Idle, What's gorn dear?
10,Graham Chapman," Nothing, nothing, I just like the word. It gives 
            me confidence. Gorn ... gorn. It's got a sort of woody quality about 
            it. Gorn. Gorn. Much better than `newspaper' or `litterbin'."
11,Carol Cleveland, Frightful words.
12,Eric Idle, Perfectly dreadful.
13,Graham Chapman," Ugh! Newspaper! ... litterbin ... dreadful tinny 
            sort of words. Tin, tin, tin."
14,Eric Idle," Oh, dear, don't say `tin' to Rebecca, you know how 
            it upsets her."
15,Graham Chapman, 
16,Eric Idle, Sausage!
17,Graham Chapman," Sausage ... there's a good woody sort of word, 
            `sausage' ... gorn."
18,Carol Cleveland, Antelope.
19,Graham Chapman, Where? On the lawn? 
20,Carol Cleveland," No, no, daddy ... just the word."
21,Graham Chapman, Don't want an antelope nibbling the hoops.
22,Carol Cleveland," No, antelope ... sort of nice and woody type of 
            thing."
23,Eric Idle," Don't think so, Becky old chap."
24,Graham Chapman," No, no, `antelope', `antelope' -- tinny sort of 
            word "
25,Eric Idle," Really, Mansfield."
26,Graham Chapman," Well, she's got to come to terms with these things 
            ... seemly ... prodding ... vacuum ... leap ..."
27,Carol Cleveland, 
28,Eric Idle, Perfectly dreadful.
29,Carol Cleveland," Sort of PVC-y sort of word, don't you know."
30,Eric Idle, Lower-middle.
31,Graham Chapman, Bound!
32,Eric Idle, Now you're talking.
33,Graham Chapman, Bound ... Vole ... Recidivist.
34,Eric Idle, Bit tinny. 
35,Graham Chapman," Oh dear, suppose she'll be gorn for a few days 
            now."
36,Eric Idle, Caribou!
37,Graham Chapman, Splendid word.
38,Eric Idle, No dear ... nibbling the hoops.
39,Graham Chapman, 
40,Eric Idle, 
41,Graham Chapman, Intercourse.
42,Eric Idle," Later, dear."
43,Graham Chapman," No, no, the word, `intercourse' -- good and woody 
            ... inter ... course ... pert ... pert thighs ... botty, botty, 
            botty ... "
44,Eric Idle," Really, dear? ... How about tit?"
45,Graham Chapman," Oh dear, I hadn't thought about that. Tit. Tit. 
            Oh, that's very tinny isn't it? "
46,Eric Idle," Oh really, must you dear? You've had nine today."
47,Graham Chapman," All right, I'll sack one of the servants ... 
            Simkins! ... nasty tinny sort of name. Simkins! "
48,Michael Palin," I say, mater, cabbage crates coming over the briny."
49,Eric Idle, 
50,Michael Palin," Er ... cowcatchers creeping up on the conning 
            towers ..."
51,Eric Idle, No ... sorry ... old sport.
52,Michael Palin, Caribou nibbling at the croquet hoops.
53,Eric Idle," Yes, Mansfield shot one in the antlers."
54,Michael Palin," Oh, jolly good show. Is 'Becca about?"
55,Eric Idle," No, she's gorn off."
56,Michael Palin, What a super woody sort of phrase. `Gorn orff'.
57,Eric Idle," Yes, she's gorn orff because Mansfield said `tin' 
            to her."
58,Michael Palin," Oh, what rotten luck ... oh well ... whole 
            afternoon to kill ... better have a bath I suppose."
59,Eric Idle," Oh, Gervaise do sing me a song ..."
60,Michael Palin," Oh, OK."
61,Eric Idle, Something woody.
62,Michael Palin," For ... she's going to marry Yum Yum ... oh crikey. 
            The old song finished her orff."
63,Graham Chapman, 
64,Michael Palin," I'm afraid Mrs. Vermin Jones appears to have passed 
            orn."
65,Graham Chapman," Dead, is she?"
66,Michael Palin, 'Fraid so.
67,Graham Chapman, What a blow for her.
0,Graham Chapman," What I want to know Mrs. Elizabeth III, 
            is why they give us crap like that, when there's bits of the 
            Leicester by-pass what have never been shown. Biscuit? "

2,Eric Idle, 
3,Graham Chapman, 
4,Graham Chapman, 
5,Terry Jones, 
6,Eric Idle," Hello and welcome to Show-Jumping from 
            White City ... "
7,Graham Chapman," Oh, moto-cross! "
8,Eric Idle," ... and it's Anneli Drummond-Hay on Mr. 
            Softee just about to go into jump-off against the clock. The short 
            pause is for the stewards who are repairing the Sound of Music. "
9,Terry Jones, Quite exciting.
10,Eric Idle," ... beautifully taken, and now she needs 
            to pick up speed for Oklahoma, but not too much. This is where Alan 
            Jones knocked down poor Judd, but ... And ... she's taken it 
            superbly! "
11,Graham Chapman," You notice how we never actually see the 
            horses jump."
12,Graham Chapman, Wait for it ...
13,Eric Idle, And! She's taken it ... 
14,Graham Chapman, I bet we don't see this one.
15,Peter Woods," We interrupt show jumping to bring you a news 
            flash. The Second World War has now entered a sentimental stage. The 
            morning on the Ardennes Front, the Germans started spooning at dawn, 
            but the British Fifth Army responded by gazing deep in their eyes, 
            and the Germans are reported to have gone 'all coy'."
0,Neil Innes,
0,Terry Jones," It's just that everywhere I go it's the same old 
            thing. All anyone wants me to say is `To be or not to be ...'"
1,Graham Chapman," `... that is the question. Whether 'tis 
            nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous 
            ...'"
2,Terry Jones, 
3,Graham Chapman, 
4,Terry Jones," Yes. All that sort of thing. And I'm just getting 
            really fed up."
5,Graham Chapman, 
6,Terry Jones," No. I'm sick of it! I want to do something else. I 
            want to make something of my life."
7,Graham Chapman, No. I don't know that bit.
8,Terry Jones, I want to get away from all that. Be different.
9,Graham Chapman, Well um ... what do you want to be?
10,Terry Jones, A private dick!
11,Graham Chapman, Why do you want to be a private dick?
12,Terry Jones," Ooh ... why does anyone want to be a private dick? 
            Fame, money, glamour, excitement, sex!"
13,Graham Chapman," Ah! It's the sex, is it?"
14,Terry Jones," Well, that's one of the things, yes."
15,Graham Chapman," Yes, what's the sex problem?"
16,Terry Jones," Well, there's no problem."
17,Graham Chapman," Now, come on, come on. You've got the girl 
            on the bed and she's all ready for it."
18,Terry Jones," No, no, it's nothing to do with that."
19,Graham Chapman, 
20,Eric Idle," All right, Mr. Butler, I'll take over. "
21,Terry Jones," Well, I was telling the other psychiatrist ..."
22,Eric Idle, He's ... he's not a psychiatrist.
23,Terry Jones, Oh. He said he was a psychiatrist.
24,Eric Idle," Well ... yes ... um, he's a kind of psychiatrist 
            he's ... he's not a proper psychiatrist. He's not er ... fully 
            qualified ... in, um, quite the sort of way we should want. Anyway 
            the problem I believe is basically sexual is it?"
25,Graham Chapman, I asked him that!
26,Eric Idle, Get out! 
27,Michael Palin, 
28,Eric Idle, I'm talking to a patient! Oh ... 
29,Michael Palin," Out please! I'm terribly sorry, sir. 
            We have a lot of problems here with bogus psychiatrists. One of the 
            risks in psychiatry I'm afraid. Unfortunately they do tend to 
            frighten the patient and they can cause real and permanent damage to 
            the treatment. But I assure you that I am a completely bona fide 
            psychiatrist. Here's my diploma in psychiatry from the University of 
            Oxford. This here shows that I'm a member of the British Psychiatric 
            Association, a very important body indeed. Here's a letter from 
            another psychiatrist in which he mentions that I'm a psychiatrist. 
            This is my Psychiatric Club tie, and as you can see the cufflinks 
            match. I've got a copy of `Psychiatry Today' in my bag, which I 
            think is pretty convincing. And a letter here from my mother in 
            which she asks how the psychiatry is going, and I think you'll 
            realize that the one person you can't fool is your mother. So if 
            you'd like to ask me any questions abut psychiatry, I bet I can 
            answer them. "
30,Terry Jones," No, no, it's all right, really."
31,Michael Palin," OK, you've got this girl on your bed, 
            you've had a few drinks, you've got her stretched out and her feet 
            on the mantelpiece ... "
32,Michael Palin," Oh, oh my God! Ok, thank you. "
33,Terry Gilliam," Right you've got the girl down on the 
            bed, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece."
34,Eric Idle," Well, well done, Mr. Hamlet. You've done 
            extremely well in out disorientation tests."
35,Terry Jones, Oh? Oh!
36,Eric Idle," You see, I'm sorry it might have confused you a 
            little, but we do this to try to establish a very good 
            doctor/patient relationship, you see ... we do it to sort of, as it 
            were, to break down the barriers. All right?"
37,Terry Jones, yes fine.
38,Eric Idle," Good! Well, you've got her legs up on the 
            mantelpiece ..."
39,Terry Jones," On behalf of the Psychiatric Association, I 
            should like to say that we are taking firm action to clamp down on 
            the activities of bogus psychiatrists. In fact in many areas of 
            modern psychiatry computers are now being increasingly used for the 
            first basic diagnosis and this has gone a long way in eliminating 
            the danger of unqualified impostors."
40,Carol Cleveland, Out!
0,Graham Chapman," Well, here I am on London's busy Westminster 
            Bridge, seeing just how much time sitting down can take. Well, I 
            arrived here by train at about 8.50, it's now 9.05, so I've been 
            here approximately twelve minutes and if it's any encouragement, I 
            must say that my legs do feel rested."
1,Michael Palin, Is this your chair?
2,Graham Chapman," Er ... well, no, it's a prop."
3,Michael Palin, It's been stolen!
4,Graham Chapman, What?
5,Michael Palin," This belongs to a Mrs. Edgeworth of Pinner -- 
            she's standing over there."
6,Graham Chapman," Ah well, it's nothing to do with me. It's just a 
            prop which the BBC ... aaargh!"
7,Michael Palin, It's got her name on the bottom. 
8,Graham Chapman," Well er ... perhaps you'd better give it back to 
            her."
9,Michael Palin," You don't believe I'm a policeman, do you?"
10,Graham Chapman, Yes I do!
11,Michael Palin, What am I wearing on my head?
12,Graham Chapman, A helmet
13,Michael Palin, 
14,Graham Chapman, Yes.
15,Michael Palin, 
16,Graham Chapman, Yes.
17,Michael Palin, That little number there?
18,Graham Chapman, Yes.
19,Michael Palin," That is a Metropolitan Area Identification 
            Code. No helmet is authentic without that number."
20,Graham Chapman, I see.
21,Michael Palin," Kids' helmets, helmets you get in toy shops, 
            helmets you buy at Christmas. None of them is authentic ... Hang on.
            "
22,Graham Chapman, Oh could I ...
23,Michael Palin, Hang on!
24,Michael Palin," Mind you I didn't join the police force just to 
            wear the helmets you know. That just happens to be one of the little 
            perks. There are plenty of jobs where I could have worn a helmet, 
            but not such a nice helmet. "
25,Graham Chapman," Well, no I don't."
26,Michael Palin," Ah! Their helmets used to look like ... you got 
            any paper? "
27,Graham Chapman, Well only these scripts.
28,Michael Palin, I'll have that!
29,Michael Palin, I say!
30,Michael Palin," Now then. Their helmet was not unlike the 
            bobby's helmet in basic shape. It had an emblem here, and three gold 
            -- and in those days it really was gold, that's part of the reason 
            the Tsar was so unpopular -- three gold bands surmounted by a golden 
            eagle on the apex here. Pretty nice helmet, eh?"
31,Graham Chapman, Yes.
32,Michael Palin," I think the domed helmet wins every time over 
            the flattened job, you know, even when they're three cornered ... "
33,Graham Chapman, 
34,Michael Palin, 
35,Michael Palin, No parked! What's that then?
36,Michael Palin," Right. I'm taking that in for forensic 
            examination."
37,Michael Palin," Because it might have been used as a murder 
            weapon, that's why! "
38,Graham Chapman, 
39,Michael Palin," Now, the Chaldeans, who used to inhabit the 
            area in between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, their helmets were 
            of the modular restrained kind of type ..."
0,Carol Cleveland," Oh Robert, tell me I'm beautiful."
1,Terry Jones," Oh you are, you are!"
2,Carol Cleveland," Oh Robert, do you mean that?"
3,Terry Jones, Of course I do.
4,Carol Cleveland, You're not just saying that because I asked you?
5,Terry Jones, Of course not.
6,Carol Cleveland," Oh Robert ... Robert, are you sure it doesn't put 
            you off? "
7,Terry Jones, What?
8,Carol Cleveland, My father wanting to come and live with us.
9,Terry Jones," No, of course I don't mind your father coming to 
            live with us. "
10,Carol Cleveland, He wouldn't just be living with us.
11,Terry Jones, What do you mean?
12,Carol Cleveland," Well, he finds it very difficult to get to sleep on 
            his own, so I said he could sleep with us."
13,Terry Jones, He wants to put his bed in our room?
14,Carol Cleveland," No, no, of course not."
15,Terry Jones, Oh good ...
16,Carol Cleveland, Our bed is plenty big enough for three ...
17,Terry Jones, What?
18,Carol Cleveland, He'd just get into bed and go to sleep.
19,Terry Jones, No. I'm not having that.
20,Carol Cleveland," Oh Robert, I thought you loved me?"
21,Terry Jones," Well I do, but ..."
22,Carol Cleveland," Well, he wouldn't look."
23,Terry Jones, He's bound to peek.
24,Carol Cleveland," No, no, he wouldn't honestly."
25,Terry Jones, No! No! No!!
26,Graham Chapman," You young couple just carry on. Take no notice of 
            me ... "
27,Carol Cleveland," Oh no dad, you're not."
28,Terry Jones," No, no."
29,Graham Chapman, Good.
30,Carol Cleveland," Well, I think I'll get to sleep."
31,Graham Chapman, Are you sure?
32,Carol Cleveland," Oh yes, I'm a bit tired after the wedding."
33,Graham Chapman," Bob, what about you?"
34,Terry Jones," Oh yes, all right, yes."
35,Graham Chapman," Oh well, I seem to be O/C lights."
36,Carol Cleveland, 
37,Terry Jones, Good night.
38,Graham Chapman, Good night!
39,Carol Cleveland," Father. Father, what are you doing?"
40,Graham Chapman, I'm making a boat.
41,Carol Cleveland, What?
42,Graham Chapman," It's the Cutty Sark. It's a model I've been making 
            in the dark for some years now."
43,Carol Cleveland," Well, wouldn't it be better with the light on?"
44,Graham Chapman," No, no, I'm making it in the dark, that's the 
            point."
45,Graham Chapman," Oh dear, not as accurate as I thought."
46,Terry Jones, It's not the Cutty Sark!
47,Graham Chapman," Well it hasn't got its sails yet. Oh well I'll ... 
            I'll have a look at it in the dark room in the morning. Good night.
            "
0,Terry Gilliam, Shut up! Will you shut up in there!
1,Terry Gilliam, Shut up! 
2,Terry Jones," I am myself indifferent honest, but then I could 
            accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne 
            me."
3,Terry Jones," O fair Ophelia, nymph, in thy orisons, be all my 
            sins remembered ..."
4,Connie Booth," So anyway, you've got the girl on the bed and her 
            legs are on the mantelpiece ..."
5,Carol Cleveland, Out! 
0,Michael Palin," That was a great fight, Champ, a great fight, you hear! Oh 
            boy, what a fight, Champ, what a great fight! You nearly had him, 
            Champ, you nearly had him ... where's his head?"
1,Michael Palin," You were great, Champ, d'you hear, you were great!"
2,Michael Palin," Yeah, I think it was a mistake him wearing spectacles. "
3,Michael Palin, 
4,Eric Idle," He was great, Mr. Gabriello."
5,Michael Palin, The way he kept fighting after his head came off!
6,Eric Idle," He was better when the head came off, Mr. Gabriello. He was 
            really dodging the guy."
7,Michael Palin," Yeah, I reckon that if he could've lasted till the end of that 
            first minute, he would've had the Killer worried."
8,Eric Idle," Sure, Mr. Gabriello."
9,Michael Palin, Oh he was great. Did you see his left arm?
10,Eric Idle, No!
11,Michael Palin," OK, we'll look around the hall after everybody's gone."
12,Eric Idle," Do you realize Mr. Gabriello, some of those guys out there paid 
            over $2,000 for a ringside seat."
13,Michael Palin," And where did the head land? Right at the back, that's 
            justice... "
14,Terry Gilliam, This your boy's head?
15,Michael Palin," No, no, we've got his head. He ain't hurt that bad."
16,Eric Idle, 
17,Michael Palin," OK, give it to me. I'm seeing his trainer tomorrow. I'll give 
            it to him."
18,Eric Idle," Hey, Mr. Gabriello. The press is still outside. Are you ready 
            for them?"
19,Michael Palin, How's the Champ?
20,Michael Palin," OK, well keep the dressing gown kinda loose, OK. "
21,Terry Jones," Hey Mr. Gabriello, Mr. Gabriello. Did you expect your boy to 
            last the full twenty-eight seconds?"
22,Michael Palin," This boy has never let me down. He's the pluckiest goddamn 
            fighter I've ever trained."
23,Carol Cleveland, Were you worried when his head started to come loose?
24,Michael Palin," No, no, we were expecting that. I told them to expect it to 
            and it did. He ain't stupid."
25,Terry Jones," Hey, can we have a word with the Champ?"
26,Michael Palin, Yeah OK. But keep the questions simple.
27,Terry Jones, Hey Champ! How're you feeling?
28,Michael Palin, 
29,Carol Cleveland," Mr. Gabriello. People are saying that the kid ought to be 
            buried. His head's come off in the last six fights."
30,Michael Palin," There's no question of burying the kid. He's just reaching the 
            top."
31,Carol Cleveland," Well, shouldn't he just stay in hospital?"
32,Michael Palin," No, he ain't going to no hospital. He's got the return fight 
            next week."
0,Michael Palin," And there's Frank Sinatra leaving the ring. 
            Behind him is George Raft, another great boxing fan, Martin Bormann, 
            acknowledging the applause, and with him of course is Gus Himmler, 
            who did an awful lot for the sport in his country in the early 
            1940s. And here comes the Champ now and he seems in good shape to 
            meet the Killer once again. Before an audience, some of them will 
            have paid $920,000 million for the privilege of seeing this boy get 
            beaten up. And there's the bell. "
1,Michael Palin," And a left and a right and a right jab that's 
            taken the Champ's shoulder off. And here's the Killer again with a 
            right and another left and a bash with a hammer and a terrific smack 
            with a heavy thud right into the skull and there's a gaping hole 
            right through the Champ's body now. And now the Killer's working on 
            the cut eye with a series of beautifully placed punches and the 
            head's coming loose. "
2,Terry Jones," Well here in London it's 12.30 and 
            time for `The Robinsons'. "
0,?, 
1,?," No, ... I've been shopping."
2,?, 
3,?, It was a bargain.
4,Graham Chapman, I wanted to listen to that!
5,Michael Palin, Morning Mrs. Non-Gorilla.
6,Michael Palin, No ... been shopping.
7,Michael Palin, A piston engine!
8,Michael Palin, Oooh! It was a bargain.
9,Graham Chapman, Hello Mrs. Non-Smoker.
10,Graham Chapman, Nope ... I've been shopping!
11,Graham Chapman, A piston engine!
12,Graham Chapman, It was a bargain!
13,Graham Chapman, Three quid!
14,Graham Chapman, Right. Thank you.
15,Graham Chapman, You don't cook it.
16,Graham Chapman," Ooooh ... never thought of that. Oh, day 
              and night, but this is wondrous strange ..."
0,Michael Palin," Hello, and welcome to `A Room in Polonius's 
            House'. Well tonight is European Cup night. One result is already in 
            from Munich. The European Cup, first round, second leg, Bayern 
            München 4397, Wrexham 1. So Wrexham going through there on 
            aggregate. Well, now it's time for racing, so let's go over to Epsom 
            and Brian McNutty."
1,Graham Chapman," Well over here at Epsom, there are chances 
            a-plenty for those who want to make a good start in ...:"
2,Graham Chapman," Well, it's only forty-four minutes from the 
            West End on the train and it's not too built up, so you can have a 
            nice garden. And the people of Epsom are a very nice class of 
            person."
3,Michael Palin," Well here in High Street Epsom, there 
            are ample opportunities for all kinds of redevelopment. As you can 
            see "
0,Eric Idle," Good afternoon. Well in fact there's still a few 
            minutes to go before the main race on the card this afternoon - the 
            Queen Victoria Handicap. So let's have a quick word with the winner 
            of the last race, one of the season's top jockeys - Ronnie Mau-Mau.
            "
1,Michael Palin," Good afternoon, Brian."
2,Eric Idle, 
3,Michael Palin," Well, a fine horse, Brian. You know you 
            can't go wrong."
4,Eric Idle, Do you fancy your chances for the Derby?
5,Michael Palin, 
6,Eric Idle," Well, let's just see if a colleague of yours agrees 
            with that. Let's just have a quick word with Desmond Willet. 
            Afternoon Des. "
7,Graham Chapman, 
8,Michael Palin, 
9,Graham Chapman, 
10,Eric Idle," Well in fact I can see last season's top jockey, 
            Johnny Knowles. "
11,?, 
12,Eric Idle," Er, could we have a box for Johnny, please. "
13,?," Hello, Brian"
14,Eric Idle," That's better. Well there you are. Three very well 
            known faces from the racing world. Thanks very much for coming along 
            this afternoon, lads."
15,Michael Palin," 
            Not at all. "
16,Eric Idle, And best wishes for the Derby.
17,Michael Palin," 
            Ah, thank you Brian, thanks very much. "
18,Eric Idle," Well in fact I hear they're ready for us now at the 
            start of the main race this afternoon. So let's go right away and 
            join Peter at the start."
0,Eric Idle," Well they're under starter's orders for this very valuable 
            Queen Victoria Handicap. And they're off, "
1,Michael Palin," Well a very exciting race there at Epsom. And now over to the 
            European Cup at Barcelona where the latest news is that Miguel 
            Otana, the burly Real Madrid striker, was sent off for breaking 
            wind in the forty-third minute. He'd already been cautioned for 
            pursing his lips earlier on in the game and now he's off! So let's 
            see a playback of that ... Brian."
2,Eric Idle, Yes ... er ... well as you can see ... there's Otana now 
3,Michael Palin, Jimmy?
4,Jimmy Hill, Good evening.
5,Michael Palin, What do you make of that?
6,Jimmy Hill," Well the referees really are clamping down these days. Only 
            last week the Belgian captain was sent off for having a Sony radio 
            cassette player. And Gonerelli, the huge Italian defender, was 
            sent off in Turin for having his sitting and dining room knocked 
            through to form an open living area."
7,Michael Palin, Hamlet?
8,Terry Jones, Good evening.
9,Michael Palin," Well you've got the girl on the bed and her legs up on the 
            mantelpiece ..."
10,Carol Cleveland," Out, out, come on, come on, out ... "
11,?," Let four captains bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage. For 
            he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royally ...
            "
12,Michael Palin, And then...
0,Terry Jones," Let's bring 'em out! Any old iron! Any old 
            iron! "
1,Terry Jones, Thank you. 
2,Michael Palin," We are here today to witness the opening of 
            a new box to replace the box which used to stand at the corner of 
            Ulverston Road and Sandwood Crescent. Owing to the road-widening 
            program carried out by the Borough Council, the Ulverston Road box 
            was removed, leaving the wall box in Esher Road as the only box for 
            the Ulverston Road area. This new box will enable the people of the 
            Ulverston Road area to post letters, post-cards and small packages 
            without recourse to the Esher Road box or to the box outside the 
            post office at Turner's Parade which many people used to use, but 
            which has now been discontinued owing to the opening of this box and 
            also the re-organization of box distribution throughout the whole 
            area, which comes into force with the opening of new boxes at the 
            Wyatt Road Post Office in July. "
3,Michael Palin," A perfectly ordinary morning in a perfectly 
            ordinary English suburb. Life goes on as it has done for years. "
4,Michael Palin," But soon this quiet pattern of life was to 
            change irrevocably. The commonplace routine of a typical Monday 
            morning would never be the same again, for into this quiet little 
            community came... Mr. Neutron!"
0,Michael Palin," Mr. Neutron! The most dangerous and terrifying 
            man in the world! The man with the strength of an army! The wisdom 
            of all the scholars in history! The man who had the power to destroy 
            the world. "
1,Michael Palin," Mr. Neutron! The man whose incredible power 
            has made him the most feared man of all time... waits for his moment 
            to destroy this little world utterly! "
2,Michael Palin," Then there's Stanley ... he's our eldest ... 
            he's a biochemist in Sutton. He's married to Shirley... "
3,Graham Chapman, 
4,Michael Palin," Yes, that's right, I think she's a lovely 
            person. "
5,Terry Jones, I hate 'er! I hate 'er guts. 
6,Michael Palin," And they, of course, they come down most 
            weekends, so you'll be able to meet them then. "
7,Graham Chapman," I'd ... love .. · to. Hairdressing is very 
            interesting. "
8,Michael Palin," And very important, too. If you don't care 
            for your scalp, you get rabies. Then there's Kenneth, he's our 
            youngest. Mind you, he's a bit of a problem... at least my husband 
            thinks he is, anyway. "
9,Terry Jones," Nasty little piece of work, he is, I hate 
            him! "
10,Michael Palin," Mind you, the one we hear so much about 
            nowadays is Karen. She married a Canadian - he's a dentist - they 
            live in Alberta - two lovely children, Gary who's three, Leslie 
            who's six. They look like the spitting image of Karen. D'you want to 
            see a photo ... ? "
11,Graham Chapman," Oh, yes please. "
12,Michael Palin, All right. 
13,Terry Jones," They're a couple of little bastards. I hate 
            'em. They've got eyes like little pigs, just like their mother. 
            She's a disaster ... a really horrible-looking person, she is. I 
            thought that one would stay on the shelf, but along comes this 
            stupid dentist git. He's a real creepy little bastard, he is. I hate 
            'im. "
14,Graham Chapman, This is a nice area. 
15,Terry Jones, It's like a bloody graveyard. I hate it. 
16,Graham Chapman," It's handy for the shops and convenient for 
            the West End. "
17,Terry Jones," If you like going to the West End. I think 
            it's a stinking dump. "
18,Michael Palin," Meanwhile in Washington, at the headquarters 
            of 'FEAR' - the Federal Egg Answering Room - in reality a front name 
            for 'FEEBLE' - the Free World Extra-Earthly Bodies Location and 
            Extermination Centre... all was not well. "
19,Eric Idle, Good God! 
20,Michael Palin, Hello? 
21,Michael Palin," This is Captain Carpenter sir, from FEAR. "
22,Michael Palin, You mean FEEBLE? 
23,Michael Palin," Yes, sir ... "
24,Michael Palin, What is it? 
25,Michael Palin," Mr. Neutron is missing, sir! "
0,Michael Palin," Mr. Neutron! Oh my God! OK - Surround the 
            entire city! Send in four waves of armed paratroopers with full 
            ground-to-air missile support! Alert all air bases! Destroy all 
            roads! We'll bomb the town fiat if we have to! "
1,Eric Idle," Sir! Sir! He's not in Washington, sir. "
2,Michael Palin," OK! Hold everything! Hold everything! Hold it! 
            Lay off! Lay off... Where is he? "
3,Eric Idle," We don't know, sir ... all we know is he 
            checked out of his hotel and took a bus to the airport. "
4,Michael Palin," All right! I want a full-scale Red Alert 
            throughout the world! Surround everyone with everything we've got! 
            Mobilize every fighting unit and every weapon we can lay our hands 
            on! I want... I want three full-scale global nuclear alerts with 
            every army, navy and air force unit on eternal standby! "
5,Eric Idle," Right, sir! "
6,Michael Palin, And introduce conscription! 
7,Eric Idle," Yes, sir! "
8,Michael Palin, Right! 
9,Eric Idle," You've got a bit of work to do there, then.
            "
10,Graham Chapman," Yes, it is a problem. "
11,Eric Idle," Mrs. Ottershaw never used to bother ... then 
            of course she was very old... she was 206! Well, must be going... if 
            you need any help I'll send Frank round. He could do with a bit of 
            exercise, ha! ha! ha! ha! ... Fat old bastard... "
12,Michael Palin, Yes? 
13,Eric Idle," Captain Carpenter here, sir. We've been on red 
            alert now for three days, sir, and still no sign of Mr. Neutron. "
14,Michael Palin," Have we bombed anywhere? Have we shown 'era we 
            got teeth?"
15,Eric Idle," Oh yes, sir. We've bombed a lot of 
            places fiat, sir. "
16,Michael Palin," Good. Good. We don't want anyone to think we're 
            chicken. "
17,Eric Idle," Oh no! They don't think that, sir. Everyone's 
            really scared of us, sir. "
18,Michael Palin, Of us? 
19,Eric Idle," Yes, sir. "
20,Michael Palin, (pleased) Of our power? 
21,Eric Idle," Oh yes, sir! They're really scared when they 
            see those big planes come over. "
22,Michael Palin," Wow! I bet they are. I bet they are. I bet 
            they're really scared. "
23,Eric Idle," Oh they are, sir. "
24,Michael Palin," Do we have any figures on how scared they are?
            "
25,Eric Idle," No ... no figures, sir. But they sure were 
            scared. "
26,Michael Palin, Ah! But it's not working? 
27,Eric Idle," No, sir. "
28,Michael Palin," OK. We'll try another tactic. We'll try and 
            out-smart this Neutron guy. Yes, there's one man who could nail him.
            "
29,Eric Idle," One guy? That won't frighten anyone, sir. "
30,Michael Palin," Hc's the most brilliant man I ever met. We were 
            in the CIA together. He's retired now. He breeds rabbits up in the 
            Yukon... ' "
31,Eric Idle," What's his name, sir? "
32,Michael Palin, His name is Teddy Salad. 
33,Eric Idle, Salad as in... ? 
34,Michael Palin," Lettuces, cucumber, radishes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
            "
35,Eric Idle," Where do I find him, sir? "
36,Michael Palin," The Yukon. Oh, and Carpenter ... "
37,Eric Idle," Yes, sir? "
38,Michael Palin, Make sure you get a decent disguise. 
39,Eric Idle," Oh, hello. My name's Carpenter. I'm from the US 
            Government. "
40,Graham Chapman, Are you from the army? 
41,Eric Idle," Er... no... I'm... er... I'm:.. I'm from the 
            ballet. The US Government Ballet. "
42,Graham Chapman, The ballet! The ballet's coming here? 
43,Eric Idle, Well maybe... 
44,Graham Chapman," Oh, that's Feat! We love the ballet. Last year 
            some of us from Yellow River got a party to go see the ballet in 
            Montreal. Dimly we can see behind the lumberjack a bevy of beautiful 
            boys of all nations. "
45,Eric Idle," Look, I was wondering... "
46,Graham Chapman," Oh, we had a marvellous time. It was Margot 
            Fonteyn dancing 'Les Sylphides'... oh, it was so beautiful... "
47,Eric Idle, Do you know... 
48,Graham Chapman, Do you know how old she is? 
49,Eric Idle, Who? 
50,Graham Chapman, Margot Fonteyn. 
51,Eric Idle, No. 
52,Graham Chapman, She's 206! 
53,Eric Idle," Look, I hear there's a US ballet organizer 
            round these parts by the name of Teddy Salad. "
54,Graham Chapman, You mean the special agent? 
55,Eric Idle, Well... 
56,Graham Chapman," He's an ex-CIA man. He's not a ballet dancer.
            "
57,Eric Idle," Well, I just want to see him on some ballet 
            business... "
58,Graham Chapman," Well, you could try the store... "
59,Eric Idle," Oh, thank you. "
60,Graham Chapman," Hey! Can you get us Lionel Blair's autograph?
            "
61,Graham Chapman," Try having an omelet for your evening meal... 
            perhaps with yoghurt and grapefruit. "
62,Graham Chapman, What about salad? 
63,Graham Chapman," No, no, no - salad - as in lettuces, 
            radishes, cucumber... "
0,Michael Palin, You don't like it?
1,Eric Idle," No, I didn't want to eat a salad. I wanted to 
            find out about a man called Salad. "
2,Michael Palin," You're the first person to order a salad for two 
            years. All the Eskimos eat here is fish, fish ... "
3,Graham Chapman, 
4,Terry Jones," Where's our fish. We've finished our fish.
            "
5,Michael Palin," What fish you want today, uh? "
6,Graham Chapman, Bream please. 
7,Michael Palin," Bream! Where do I get a bream this time of year? 
            You bloody choosy Eskimo pests. "
8,Graham Chapman, We are not Eskimos! 
9,Michael Palin," Why don't you like a nice plate of cannelloni?
            "
10,Graham Chapman, That's not fish. 
11,Michael Palin, 
12,Eric Idle, 
13,Graham Chapman, We're not Eskimos! 
14,Michael Palin, 
15,Eric Idle, 
16,Graham Chapman," What, Salad as in... "
17,Eric Idle," Lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes ... yes. "
18,Graham Chapman, Like you have on your plate? 
19,Eric Idle, Yes. That's right. 
20,Graham Chapman," No, I'm afraid not. "
21,Terry Jones, Where's our fish? 
22,Graham Chapman, What does this Teddy Salad do? 
23,Eric Idle, He's a... er... hen-teaser. 
24,Eric Idle, Che cosa è la stucciacatori di polli? 
25,Graham Chapman," No, the only Teddy Salad we know is a CIA 
            man. "
26,Eric Idle," Oh, he might know. "
27,Eric Idle, Where will I find him? 
28,Terry Jones," Oh, he lives up at Kipper Sound. "
29,Eric Idle, Thanks a lot. 
30,Graham Chapman," Are you in international spying, too? "
31,Eric Idle," No... no... I'm with the... US Ballet... 
            force... who are you with? "
32,Graham Chapman, 
33,Michael Palin, Here's your bloody fish. 
34,Graham Chapman," Thank you, Anouk. "
35,Michael Palin, I'm not an Eskimo! 
36,Eric Idle, Hey! Hey! 
37,Eric Idle, Hi! I'm Carpenter of the US Ballet. 
38,Terry Jones," Hey, great to have you around. The last decent 
            ballet we got around here was Ballet Ramben. On Thursday they did 'Petrouchka', 
            then on Saturday they did 'Fille Mal Gardée'. I thought it was a bit 
            slow... "
39,Eric Idle, 
40,Terry Jones, I ain't Salad. 
41,Eric Idle, What? 
42,Terry Jones, You want Teddy Salad? 
43,Eric Idle, Yeah ... 
44,Terry Jones," The one on the end, on the right. That's Salad.
            "
45,Eric Idle, That's a dog! 
46,Terry Jones, 
47,Eric Idle, What do you mean? 
48,Terry Jones," Listen, Teddy Salad is the most brilliant agent 
            the CIA ever had, right? "
49,Eric Idle, Right. 
50,Terry Jones, That's how he made his name 
51,Eric Idle, That's incredible! 
52,Terry Jones," He had to slim down to one and a half pounds to 
            get into that costume. He cut eighteen inches off each arm and over 
            three feet off each leg. The most brilliant surgeon in Europe stuck 
            that tail on. "
53,Eric Idle, What about the head? 
54,Terry Jones," All of the head was removed apart from the eyes 
            and the brain in order to fit into the costume. "
55,Eric Idle, That's incredible! 
56,Terry Jones, D'you want to talk to him? 
57,Eric Idle," Yeah, sure. "
58,Terry Jones, 
59,Terry Jones, 
60,Eric Idle, What does he say? 
61,Terry Jones, 
62,Eric Idle, 
63,Terry Jones, He wants to go walkies. 
64,Eric Idle, Walkies? 
65,Terry Jones," Yeah, he's right into it today - d'you mind 
            taking him for walkies? "
66,Michael Palin," While Carpenter took the most brilliant agent 
            the CIA ever had for walkies, events in the world's capitals were 
            moving fast! "
0,Michael Palin," The Secretary of State to see you, Prime Minister.
            "
1,Eric Idle," Very well, show him in. "
2,Michael Palin, Prime Minister. 
3,Eric Idle, Do take a seat. 
4,Michael Palin," Prime Minister, we've just had the 
            Supreme Commander US Forces on the phone. Apparently they want a 
            full-scale Red Alert! "
5,Eric Idle, They what? 
6,Michael Palin," They want a full-scale Red Alert - 
            every troop movement... "
7,Eric Idle," It's all right - don't worry about 
            Giuseppe... "
8,Michael Palin," Well apparently the whole structure of 
            world peace may be threatened unless we immediately... "
9,Terry Jones, 
10,Eric Idle," No, no, Giuseppe - not now. "
11,Terry Jones, 
12,Eric Idle, No. 
13,Terry Jones," Oh, signora ... my mistake! I play for you 'My 
            Mistake'. "
14,Eric Idle," Giuseppe, do you mind playing over there.
            "
15,Terry Jones, 
16,Michael Palin," Well anyway, this Mr. Neutron, is 
            located somewhere in the London area. We must find and exterminate 
            him. The Americans say if we don't, they will. "
17,Eric Idle, 
18,Michael Palin," The Americans say if we won't they 
            will! "
19,Eric Idle, That he doesn't know what? 
20,Michael Palin," They'll bomb the entire London area.
            "
21,Eric Idle, 
22,Michael Palin, They won't bomb here. 
23,Eric Idle, Are you sure? 
24,Michael Palin, Sure. 
25,Eric Idle, 
26,Michael Palin," Well apparently they haven't got 
            Neutron yet... but when they do... "
27,Terry Jones, Well. Did he tell you anything? 
28,Eric Idle, 
29,Terry Jones, 
30,Eric Idle," Look, we haven't got much time .. · He hasn't 
            given me any information yet... "
31,Terry Jones," OK. Tell you what, let's eat. You give him one of 
            your meatballs, he'll tell you anything.. · OK? "
32,Eric Idle, OK. 
33,Terry Jones," Wait a minute - he's trying to tell us something.
            "
34,Michael Palin's Voice, Carpenter ... er ... ugh ... ah...Carpenter... 
35,Eric Idle, 
36,Michael Palin's Voice," Yes... yes... it's just it's so goddam painful in 
            here... what's the problem? "
37,Eric Idle," It's Mr. Neutron, sir ... he's gone missing. 
            The Supreme Commander wants you to take charge. "
38,Michael Palin's Voice, I ... oh God ... I ... I ... I... 
39,Eric Idle," Yes, Mr. Salad? "
40,Michael Palin's Voice, I gotta go walkies again. 
41,Michael Palin," Still no sign of Captain Carpenter, sir... or Mr. 
            Neutron. "
42,Michael Palin," And so the Great Powers and the people of 
            Shahkiln, Isle of Wight, drew their net in ever-tightening circles 
            around the most dangerous threat to peace the world has ever faced. 
            They bombed Cairo, Bangkok, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, Harrow, 
            Hammersmith, Stephey, Wandsworth and Enfield... But always it was 
            the wrong place. "
43,Michael Palin," But what of Mr. Neutron, the most fearfully 
            dangerous man in the world! The man who could destroy entire 
            galaxies with his wrist, the man who could tear fruit machines apart 
            with his eyeballs... He had not been idle! "
0,Michael Palin," In fact he had fallen in love... with the lady 
            who 'does' for Mrs. Entrail... "
1,Terry Jones," Oh 'ello Mr. N, terrible about Enfield, innit? 
            It's all gone. So's Staines ... lovely shops they used to have in 
            Staines... and Stunmore, where the AA offices used to be. I don't 
            know where we'll pay our AA subscriptions to now. Do you know where 
            we'll have to pay our AA. subscriptions to now, Mr. N? "
2,Graham Chapman," 1 didn't know you were a member of the AA 
            Mrs. S .C.U.M. "
3,Terry Jones," Oh yes. Ever since the Corsair broke down in 
            Leyonstone ... they towed it all the way to Deauville FOC. "
4,Graham Chapman," Oh, forget about your husband, Mrs. S.C.U.M. 
            - or may I call you Mrs. S? "
5,Terry Jones," You can call me Linda, if you like. "
6,Graham Chapman," No, I'd rather call you Mrs. S. "
7,Terry Jones, Oh... 
8,Graham Chapman, 
9,Terry Jones, Well... that's what I was calling you. 
10,Graham Chapman," Mrs. S, there is something I have to tell 
            you... "
11,Terry Jones," Yes, Mr. N? "
12,Graham Chapman," I have just won a Kellogg's Corn Flake 
            Competition. "
13,Terry Jones, Oh Mr. N! That's wonderful! 
14,Graham Chapman," I got the ball in exactly the right place· 
            The prize is £5,000 in cash, or as much ice cream as you can eat.
            "
15,Terry Jones," £5,000! "
16,Graham Chapman, I was thinking of taking the ice cream. 
17,Terry Jones, 
18,Graham Chapman, It's been so hot recently. 
19,Terry Jones, You couldn't eat that much ice cream Mr. N. 
20,Graham Chapman," Mrs. S, I can eat enormous quantifies of ice 
            cream without being sick. "
21,Terry Jones," Oh no! Take the £5,000! Please take the £5,000.
            "
22,Graham Chapman, I was thinking. If we got married... 
23,Terry Jones, Oh yes! 
24,Graham Chapman," We could use the £5,000 to buy a spoon... "
25,Terry Jones, Oh! We could buy a lot more than that! 
26,Graham Chapman, And then fill up with ice cream. 
27,Terry Jones," Not Forget about the ice cream. We need the 
            money. "
28,Graham Chapman," We need nothing. For there is something I 
            have not told you Mrs. S.C.U.M. "
29,Terry Jones, Oh please call me Mrs. S. 
30,Graham Chapman," No I would rather go back to calling you Mrs. 
            S.C.U.M., Mrs. S.C.U.M. I am the most powerful man in the universe. 
            There is nothing I cannot do. "
31,Terry Jones, Oh Mr. N. 
32,Graham Chapman," I want you to be my helpmate. As Tarzan had 
            his Jane, as Napoleon had his Josephine, as Frankie Laine had 
            whoever he had, I want you to help me in my plan to dominate the 
            world! "
33,Terry Jones, Oh Mr. N. That I should be so lucky! 
34,Graham Chapman, You're not Jewish are you? 
35,Eric Idle," Please, Mr. Salad .... you must tell us where 
            Neutron is. "
36,Eric Idle," Please, Mr. Salad... "
37,Eric Idle," Please, Mr. Salad - there isn't much time. 
            Where will we find Neutron? "
38,Eric Idle, Yes yes - quick. 
39,Eric Idle, OK where is he? 
40,Eric Idle, No? 
41,Eric Idle, No? 
42,Eric Idle, No? 
43,Eric Idle, Yeah? 
44,Eric Idle, Yeah! 
45,Michael Palin, OK. That's the Yukon - what's left? 
46,Michael Palin, OK! Let's start with my office.

49,Graham Chapman," I will take you away from all this Mrs. 
            S.C.U.M. "
50,Terry Jones," Oh, Mr. N... I'd follow you anywhere. "
51,Graham Chapman, We will have two weeks in Benidorm. 
52,Terry Jones, Oh yes ... yes. 
53,Graham Chapman," And I will make you the most beautiful woman 
            in the world. "
54,Terry Jones," Oh... it's beautiful... oh, Mr. N, you have 
            made my heart sing... "
55,Graham Chapman," Shut up, Mrs. S. We must hurry... "
56,Terry Jones," I'd better leave a note for Ken... he'll be 
            expecting us... "
57,Michael Palin," Has Mr. Neutron escaped in time? Is the world 
            utterly destroyed? How can Mr. Neutron and his child bride survive? 
            Will his mighty powers be of any avail against the holocaust? Stay 
            tuned to this channel. "
58,Eric Idle," Hello. Well in fact what happens is that they are 
            saved by Mr. Neutron's mighty powers just as the last bomb falls on 
            Ruislip. "
59,Eric Idle," However, the Earth has been blown off its axis, and 
            in a most dramatic and dangerous and expensive sequence, it spins 
            off into space. There are appallingly expensive scenes of 
            devastation and horror and the find incredibly expensive climax is 
            reached as thousands of ape monsters in very expensive costumes 
            descend from the sky onto these, plug up a whole city which has to 
            be specially built and fling them all into the sea very expensively. 
            And we can see those very expensive scenes fight now. "
0,Michael Palin," Good evening, last week we learned how to saw a 
            lady in half. This week we're going to learn how to saw a lady into 
            three bits and dispose of the body... "
1,Eric Idle," Look if you can put on rubbish like that, and 'Horse 
            of the Year Show', you can afford us another minute, Mr. Cotion, 
            please, I mean look at this load of old... "

            BBC, World Domination Department, Cardiff. "
0,Eric Idle," Pratt... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a 
            long ball out to Pratt... and now Pratt is on the ball, a neat 
            little flick back inside to Pratt, who takes it nicely and sends it 
            through on the far side to Pratt, Pratt with it but passes instead 
            to Pratt, Pratt again, oh and well intercepted by the swarthy little 
            number nine, Concito ' Maracon. This twenty-one-year-old half back, 
            remarkably stocky for 6' 3"", square shouldered, balding giant, hair 
            flowing in the wind, bright eyed, pert, young for his age but oh so 
            old in so many ways. For a thirty-nine year-old you wouldn't expect 
            such speed. Normally considered slow, he's incredibly fast as he 
            wanders aimlessly around, sweeping up and taking the defense to the 
            cleaners. Who would have thought, though many expected it, that this 
            remarkable forty-five-year-old, 9' 4"" dwarf of a man, who is still 
            only seventeen in some parts of the world, would ever really be ... 
            Oh and there was a goal there apparently ... and now it's Pratt ... 
            back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball to Pratt... "
1,Terry Jones," I like this Ano-Weet, it really unclogs me.
            "
2,Eric Idle," Oh, do be careful. "
3,Michael Palin," Sorry, mum. "
4,Terry Jones," I mean a lot of others say they unclog you, 
            but I never had a single bowel movement with the 'Recto-Puffs'. "
5,Michael Palin, Now if we ... 
6,Graham Chapman, 
7,Terry Jones, Language! 
8,Graham Chapman, Well he gets on my sodding wick. 
9,Terry Jones, That's better. 
10,Terry Jones," No, the stuff I liked was that stuff they 
            gave us before the war, what was it - Wilkinson's Number 8 Laxative 
            Cereal. Phew. That one went through you like a bloody Ferrari... "
11,Eric Idle," Now, who's that at this time of day... "
12,Terry Jones," If it's the man to empty the Elsan, tell him 
            it's in the hall. "
13,Eric Idle," Right, dear. "
14,Terry Jones," And make sure that you hold it the right way 
            up! "
15,Michael Palin, Dad... ? 
16,Michael Palin," No no, my dad... "
17,Michael Palin," Dad? Why is Rhodesia called Rhodesia?...
            "
18,Eric Idle," No... no, really, thank you very much... 
            no, thank you for calling, not today, thank you. Good morning. "
19,Terry Jones, Who was that? 
20,Eric Idle, 
21,Michael Palin," Sorry, mum. "
22,Eric Idle, Go and sit down! 
23,Michael Palin," Mum? Do you know why Rhodesia's called 
            Rhodesia? "
24,Terry Jones," Do you remember 'Go-Eazi'? They were 
            hopeless... "
25,Graham Chapman, 
26,Eric Idle, When are you coming back tonight? 
27,Graham Chapman, 3 a.m. 
28,Eric Idle," I think it's disgusting... you a Member of 
            Parliament. "
29,Terry Jones," I heard you in the hall last night, snogging 
            away. "
30,Graham Chapman, I wasn't snogging! 
31,Terry Jones," Sounded like snogging to me. I could hear 
            his great wet slobbering lips going at yer ... and his hand going up 
            yet... "
32,Eric Idle, Dad! 
33,Eric Idle, No ... not you. 
34,Eric Idle, Just mind your language... 
35,Michael Palin," Oh, sorry, mum. "
36,Terry Gilliam, 
37,Graham Chapman," We was talking, we was not snogging. "
38,Terry Jones," Talking about snogging, I'll bet... "
39,Graham Chapman," If you must know, we was talking about 
            Council re-housing. "
40,Eric Idle, 
41,Terry Gilliam, 
42,Terry Jones," Where to re-house his right hand, that's 
            what he was interested in! "
43,Eric Idle," And has Faye Dunaway definitely said yes?
            "
44,Graham Chapman," He is the Chairman of the Housing 
            sub-committee. "
45,Terry Jones," Snogging sub-committee, more like... "
46,Terry Gilliam, Beans!! 
47,Eric Idle, Shut up!! 
48,Michael Palin," Yea, mum. "
49,Terry Jones, 
50,Michael Palin," Sorry, mum. "
51,Terry Gilliam, 
52,Eric Idle, Shut up! 
53,Michael Palin," A very good try there, by the Garibaldi family 
            of Droitwich in Worcestershire. Professor... "
54,Eric Idle," Well, I can't make up my mind about this 
            family... I don't think there was the sustained awfulness that we 
            really need. I mean, the father was appalling... "
55,Terry Jones, Appalling... yes .... 
56,Eric Idle," He was dirty, smelly and distasteful ... and I 
            liked him very much ... but... "
57,Michael Palin, Lady Organs? 
58,Terry Jones," Well ... they were an unpleasant family 
            certainly, but I don't think we had enough of the really gross 
            awfulness that we're looking for... "
59,Michael Palin," Well, harsh words there for the Garibaldi 
            family of Droitwich in Worcestershire, at present holders of the 
            East Midlands Most Awful Family Award - Lower Middle-Class Section 
            but unable today to score more than fifteen on our disgustometer. 
            Well with the scores all in from the judges, the Garibaldis are 
            number three ... and a surprise number two ... the 
            Fanshaw-Churnleighs of Berkshire... "
60,Eric Idle, What a super meal. 
61,Michael Palin," Absolutely super. Pat and Max are coming 
            down from Eton to help daddy count money. "
62,Graham Chapman, How absolutely super. 
63,Terry Jones," My man at Poirer's says I could have my 
            whole body lifted for £5,500 "
64,Eric Idle, How super... 
65,Michael Palin," Well, some of the wonderful behavior that made 
            the Fanshaw-Chumleighs the second Most Awful Family in Britain 1974. 
            But the winners, by a clear ten point margin, are once again the 
            awful Jodrell family of Durham. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to 
            show you some of the performance that won them an award, but I 
            assure you it was of the very highest standard, was it not, Lady 
            Organs? "
66,Terry Jones," Oh, yes, superb ... Mr. Jodrell - you know, 
            the old grandfather, who licks the ... "
67,Michael Palin, 
68,Terry Jones," He's superb. His gobbing is consistent and 
            accurate. His son is a dirty foul little creature, and those 
            frightful scabs which Mrs. Jodrell licks off the cat are... "
69,Michael Palin, 
70,Eric Idle," The Jodrells win every bloody year... makes you 
            vomit ... dad? "
71,Terry Jones, Yes? 
72,Eric Idle, Get your stinking feet off the bread. 
73,Terry Jones, I'm only wiping the cat's do's off. 
74,Terry Gilliam, Mum? 
75,Eric Idle," Shut yet face, Douglas. "

7,Terry Jones, All right I'll have some Icelandic Honey.
8,Graham Chapman," No, there is no such thing."
9,Terry Jones, You mean you don't make any honey at all?
10,Graham Chapman," No, no, we must import it all. Every bally drop. We 
            are a gloomy people. It's so crikey cold and dark up there, and only 
            fish to eat. Fish and imported honey. Oh strewth!"
11,Eric Idle, Well why do you have a week?
12,Graham Chapman," Listen Buster! In Reykyavik it is dark for eight 
            months of the year, and it's cold enough to freeze your wrists off 
            and there's only golly fish to eat. Administrative errors are bound

            stuff, then?"

            you see - and to ring this bell, and to take this card along to your 
            hospital. "
1,Graham Chapman," Ah, yes you must be Mr. Williams."
2,Terry Jones, 
3,Graham Chapman," Well, do take a seat. What seems to be the

            "
5,Graham Chapman," Oh dear.... well I'd probably better have a look 
            at you then. Could you fill in this form first? "
6,Terry Jones, She just stabbed me...
7,Graham Chapman," Yes. She's an unpredictable sort. Look, you seem 
            to be bleeding rather badly. I think you'd better hurry up and fill 
            in that form."
8,Terry Jones," Ahhh ... couldn't ... I ... do ... it ... later, 
            doctor!"
9,Graham Chapman," No, no. You'd have bled to death by then. Can you 
            hold a pen?"
10,Terry Jones, I'll try.
11,Graham Chapman," Yes, it's a hell of a nuisance all this damn 
            paperwork, really it is... "
12,Terry Jones," Do I have to answer all the questions, doctor?
            "
13,Graham Chapman," No, no, no, just fill in as many as you can - no 
            need to go into too much detail. I don't know why we bother with it 
            all, really, it's such a nuisance. Well let's see how you've done, 
            then... "

22,Carol Cleveland, 'Fraid so.
23,Graham Chapman," You mustn't kill them, nurse."
24,Carol Cleveland," Oh, I'm sorry doctor. It was just on the spur of 
            the moment. Rather silly really."
25,Terry Jones," I'm sorry about the carpet, doctor."
26,Graham Chapman," Mr. Williams, I'm afraid I can't give you any 
            marks, so I won't be able to recommend you for hospital. Tell you 
            what - I'll stop the bleeding - but strictly speaking I shouldn't 
            even do that on marks like these..."
27,Carol Cleveland," There are no more patients now, doctor."
28,Graham Chapman," Oh well, let's-go and have lunch, then."
29,Carol Cleveland, What about... er... 
30,Graham Chapman," Ah yes - look, Mr. Williams we're just popping out 
            for a bite of lunch while we've got a spare moment, you know. Look, 
            have another bash at the form... and if at least you can answer the 
            question on history right, then we may be able to give you some 
            morphine or something like that, OK?"

            re-introduced in the first and second division. Any player found 
            tackling from behind or controlling the ball with the lower part of 
            the arm will be hanged. But the electric chair remains the standard 
            punishment for threatening the goalie. Referee's chairman, Len 
            Goebbels said 'at last the referee has been given teeth'. Finally, 
            politics: the latest opinion poll published today shows Labour ahead 
            with 40%, the AA second with 38% and not surprisingly Kentucky Fried 
            Chicken running the Liberals a very close third. And now back to me.
