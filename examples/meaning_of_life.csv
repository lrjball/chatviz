32,ANNOUNCER, Part One: The Miracle of Birth. 
33,OBSTETRICIAN, One thousand and eight! 
34,NURSE #1," Mrs. Moore's contractions are more frequent, doctor!
        "
35,OBSTETRICIAN," Good. Take her into the Foetus Frightening Room.
        "
36,NURSE #1, Right. 
37,OBSTETRICIAN," Thum, thummm, thummm, thum, thummmm, thummmmmm. 
        Thum, thummm. Thummm. Jolly good. "
38,DOCTOR SPENSER," Bumm, bumm, bumm, bumm, bum-- "
39,OBSTETRICIAN," So, it's a bit bare in here today, isn't it? "
40,DOCTOR SPENSER, Yes. 
41,OBSTETRICIAN," Yes. More apparatus, please, nurse: the E.E.G., 
        the B.P. monitor, and the A.V.V. "
42,NURSE #1," Yes. Certainly, Doctor. "
43,DOCTOR SPENSER," And, uh, get the machine that goes 'ping'. "
44,OBSTETRICIAN," And get the most expensive machines, in case the 
        administrator comes. "
45,DOCTOR SPENSER, 
46,OBSTETRICIAN, That's it. Just behind me. 
47,DOCTOR SPENSER," Yeahhh, that's more like it. "
48,OBSTETRICIAN," Eehhh. Still something missing, though. "
49,DOCTOR SPENSER, Hm? 
50,OBSTETRICIAN, Hmmm. Mmmmm. 
51,OBSTETRICIAN and DOCTOR SPENSER, Patient! 
52,OBSTETRICIAN, Yes. 
53,DOCTOR SPENSER, Where's the patient? 
54,OBSTETRICIAN, Anyone seen the patient? 
55,DOCTOR SPENSER, Patient? 
56,NURSE #1, Aah! Here she is. 
57,DOCTOR SPENSER, Bring it over here. 
58,NURSE #1," Sorry, Doctor Spenser. "
59,OBSTETRICIAN, Come along! 
60,DOCTOR SPENSER, Come along. 
61,NURSE #1, Jump up there. Up! 
62,MRS. MOORE, Ehh. 
63,OBSTETRICIAN," Hallo. Now, don't you worry. "
64,DOCTOR SPENSER, We'll soon have you cured. 
65,OBSTETRICIAN," Leave it all to us. You'll never know what hit 
        you. "
66,DOCTOR SPENSER, Good-bye! 
67,OBSTETRICIAN, Good-bye. 
68,DOCTOR SPENSER, Drips up! 
69,OBSTETRICIAN, Injections! 
70,DOCTOR SPENSER, Can I put the tube in the baby's head? 
71,OBSTETRICIAN, Only if I can do the epesiotomy. 
72,DOCTOR SPENSER, Okay. 
73,OBSTETRICIAN," Okay. Uh, legs up! Doctor, come in. Come on in, 
        all of you. That's it. Jolly good. "
74,DOCTOR SPENSER, Come along. 
75,OBSTETRICIAN," Come along. Spread 'round there. Uh, who are 
        you? "
76,MR. MOORE, I'm the husband. 
77,OBSTETRICIAN," I'm sorry. Only people involved are allowed in 
        here. All right. "
78,MRS. MOORE, What do I do? 
79,DOCTOR SPENSER, Mhm. Yes? 
80,MRS. MOORE, What do I do? 
81,DOCTOR SPENSER," Nothing, dear. You're not qualified! "
82,OBSTETRICIAN, Leave it to us! 
83,MRS. MOORE, What's that for? 
84,OBSTETRICIAN, That's the machine that goes 'ping'. 
85,DOCTOR SPENSER," And that's the most expensive machine in the 
        whole hospital! "
86,OBSTETRICIAN," Yes, it cost over three quarters of a million 
        pounds. "
87,DOCTOR SPENSER, Aren't you lucky?! 
88,NURSE #2," The administrator is here, doctor. "
89,OBSTETRICIAN, Switch everything on! 
90,MR. PYCROFT," Morning, gentlemen. "
91,RANDOM, Morning. 
92,MR. PYCROFT," Morning, gentlemen. "
93,DOCTOR SPENSER, Morning! 
94,OBSTETRICIAN," Morning, Mr. Pycroft. "
95,DOCTOR SPENSER," Morning, Mr. Pycroft. "
96,MR. PYCROFT," Oh, very impressive. Very impressive. And what 
        are you doing this morning? "
97,OBSTETRICIAN, It's a birth. 
98,MR. PYCROFT, Aahh. What sort of thing is that? 
99,DOCTOR SPENSER," Well, that's when we take a new baby out of a 
        lady's tummy. "
100,MR. PYCROFT, Wonderful what we can do nowadays. 
101,NURSE #1," Ooh, the vulva's dilating, doctor. "
102,OBSTETRICIAN," Oh, yes, there's the head. Yes, four 
        centimetres. Five-- Six centimetres. "
103,DOCTOR SPENSER, Lights! 
104,OBSTETRICIAN, Amplify the 'ping' machine. 
105,DOCTOR SPENSER, Masks up! 
106,OBSTETRICIAN, Suction! 
107,DOCTOR SPENSER, Eyes down for a full house! 
108,OBSTETRICIAN, Here it comes! 
109,BABY, 
110,OBSTETRICIAN, And... frighten it! Thank you. 
111,DOCTOR SPENSER, And the rough towels! 
112,OBSTETRICIAN, Show it to the mother. That's enough. 
113,DOCTOR SPENSER, Right! Sedate her! 
114,OBSTETRICIAN, Number the child. 
115,DOCTOR SPENSER," Measure it, blood type it, and isolate it! "
116,NURSE #1, Okay. 
117,OBSTETRICIAN, Jolly good. 
118,RANDOM, 
119,OBSTETRICIAN, Jolly good. 
120,MRS. MOORE, Is it a boy or a girl? 
121,OBSTETRICIAN," Now, I think it's a little early to start 
        imposing roles on it, don't you? Now, a word of advice. You may find 
        that you suffer for some time a totally irrational feeling of 
        depression: 'P.N.D.', as we doctors call it. So, it's lots of happy 
        pills for you, and you can find out all about the birth when you get 
        home. It's available on Betamax, VHS, and Super Eight. "

123,DAD," Oh, bloody hell. "
124,BABY, 
125,MUM," Ohh, get that, would you, Deirdre? "
126,DIERDRE," All right, Mum. "
127,BABY, 
128,CHILDREN, 
129,MUM," Now, whose teatime is it? "
130,CHILDREN, Mine! 
131,MUM," Come on, now. Out you go. Now, uh, Vincent, Tessa, 
        Valerie, Janine, Martha, Andrew, Thomas, Walter, Pat, Linda, Michael, 
        Evadne, Alice, Dominique, and Sasha, it's your bedtime. "
132,CHILDREN," Aww, Mum! "
133,MUM," Now, don't argue! Laura, Alfred, Nigel, Annie, Simon, 
        Amanda,-- "
134,DAD, Wait! I've got something to tell the whole family. 
135,MUM," Oh, quick. Go and get the others in, Gordon. "
136,CHILDREN, What could it be? Shhh... 
137,DAD," The mill's closed! There's no more work. We're destitute.
        "
138,CHILDREN, 
139,DAD," Come in, my little loves. I've got no option but to sell 
        you all for scientific experiments. "
140,CHILDREN, 
141,DAD," No, no. That's the way it is, my loves. Blame the 
        Catholic church for not letting me wear one of those little rubber 
        things. Oh, they've done some wonderful things in their time. They 
        preserved the might and majesty, the mystery of the Church of Rome, and 
        the sanctity of the sacraments, the indivisible oneness of the Trinity, 
        but if they'd let me wear one of those little rubber things on the end 
        of my cock, we wouldn't be in the mess we are now. "
142,BOY, Couldn't Mummy have worn some sort of pessary? 
143,DAD," Not if we're going to remain members of the fastest 
        growing religion in the world, my boy. "
144,MUM," Ehhh, he's right. "
145,DAD," You see, we believe-- "

164,EVERYONE, 
165,DAD," So, you see my problem, little ones: I can't keep you all 
        here any longer. "
166,GIRL, Speak up! 
167,DAD," I can't keep you all here any longer! God has blessed us 
        so much, I can't afford to feed you anymore. "
168,NIGEL, Couldn't you have your balls cut off? 
169,DAD," Hohh, it's not as simple as that, Nigel. God knows all! 
        He'd see through such a cheap trick. What we do to ourselves, we do to 
        Him. "
170,GIRL, You could have had them pulled off in an accident. 
171,CHILDREN, 
172,DAD," No. No, children. I know you're trying to help, but, 
        believe me,... "
173,CHILDREN, Ohh... 
174,DAD," ...me mind's made up. I've given this long and careful 
        thought, and it has to be medical experiments for the lot of you. "
175,CHILDREN, Ohh. Oh. Oh... 
176,CHILDREN, 
177,MR. HARRY BLACKITT," Look at them, bloody Catholics, filling 
        the bloody world up with bloody people they can't afford to bloody feed.
        "
178,MRS. BLACKITT, What are we dear? 
179,MR. BLACKITT," Protestant, and fiercely proud of it. "
180,MRS. BLACKITT," Hmm. Well, why do they have so many children?
        "
181,MR. BLACKITT," Because... every time they have sexual 
        intercourse, they have to have a baby. "
182,MRS. BLACKITT," But it's the same with us, Harry. "
183,MR. BLACKITT, What do you mean? 
184,MRS. BLACKITT," Well, I mean, we've got two children, and we've 
        had sexual intercourse twice. "
185,MR. BLACKITT," That's not the point. We could have it any time 
        we wanted. "
186,MRS. BLACKITT, Really? 
187,MR. BLACKITT," Oh, yes, and, what's more, because we don't 
        believe in all that Papist claptrap, we can take precautions. "
188,MRS. BLACKITT," What, you mean... lock the door? "
189,MR. BLACKITT," No, no. I mean, because we are members of the 
        Protestant Reformed Church, which successfully challenged the autocratic 
        power of the Papacy in the mid-sixteenth century, we can wear little 
        rubber devices to prevent issue. "
190,MRS. BLACKITT, What d'you mean? 
191,MR. BLACKITT," I could, if I wanted, have sexual intercourse 
        with you,... "
192,MRS. BLACKITT," Oh, yes, Harry. "
193,MR. BLACKITT," ...and, by wearing a rubber sheath over my old 
        feller, I could insure... that, when I came off, you would not be 
        impregnated. "
194,MRS. BLACKITT, Ooh! 
195,MR. BLACKITT," That's what being a Protestant's all about. 
        That's why it's the church for me. That's why it's the church for anyone 
        who respects the individual and the individual's right to decide for him 
        or herself. When Martin Luther nailed his protest up to the church door 
        in fifteen-seventeen, he may not have realized the full significance of 
        what he was doing, but four hundred years later, thanks to him, my dear, 
        I can wear whatever I want on my John Thomas,... "
196,MRS. BLACKITT, You what? 
197,MR. BLACKITT," French Ticklers. Black Mambos. Crocodile Ribs. 
        Sheaths that are designed not only to protect, but also to enhance the 
        stimulation of sexual congress. "
198,MRS. BLACKITT, Have you got one? 
199,MR. BLACKITT," Have I got one? Uh, well, no, but I can go down 
        the road any time I want and walk into Harry's and hold my head up high 
        and say in a loud, steady voice, 'Harry, I want you to sell me a condom. 
        In fact, today, I think I'll have a French Tickler, for I am a 
        Protestant.' "
200,MRS. BLACKITT," Well, why don't you? "
201,MR. BLACKITT," But they-- Well, they cannot, 'cause their 
        church never made the great leap out of the Middle Ages and the 
        domination of alien episcopal supremacy. "
202,NARRATOR #1," The Adventures of Martin Luther,... an exciting 
        and controversial examination of the Protestant reformer whose 
        re-assessment of the role of the individual in Christian belief shook 
        the foundations of a post-feudal Germany in the grip of the sixteenth 
        century. It was a day much like any other in the quiet little town of 
        Wittenberg. Mamie Meyer was preparing fat for the evening meal when the 
        full force of the Reformation struck. "
203,HYMIE MEYER, Mamie! Martin Luther's out! 
204,MAMIE MEYER, Ohh! Martin Luther! Mmh. 
205,HYMIE, Huhh. 
206,MAMIE," Did you get the suet, Hymie? "
207,HYMIE," Oy veh! The suet I clean forgot. Look out; here he 
        comes! "
208,MAMIE, Girls! Girls! 
209,HYMIE, Mmhm... 
210,MAMIE, Your father forgot the suet! 
211,AUDREY MEYER, Ooohhhh. 
212,MYRTLE MEYER, Ohh. 
213,HYMIE," Hello, Martin. "
214,MARTIN LUTHER, H-- How-- Where's the john? 
215,HYMIE," Uh, we don't have one. "
216,AUDREY and MYRTLE, 
217,MARTIN, Hhh! Do you need any cleaning inside? 
218,HYMIE," Oh, no. Today it's all going fine. "
219,MARTIN," Ahhh. Oh, well, uh, how's about showing me the 
        cutlery? "
220,HYMIE," Martin, I got a woman and children in there. "
221,MARTIN," So! There's no problem. I just look at a few spoons, 
        uh-- "
222,HYMIE," Well, I got two girls in there, Martin. You know what I 
        mean. "
223,MARTIN," Honest! I don't look at your girls. I-- I don't think 
        about them. There! "
224,HYMIE, You just want to see the spoons? 
225,MARTIN, My life! That's what I want to see! 
226,HYMIE, I know I'm going to regret this. 
227,AUDREY, Mhhm. 
228,MAMIE, Shh! 
229,HYMIE, Mamie! Guess who's come to see us? 
230,MAMIE," Hymie! Are you out of your mind, already?! You know how 
        old your daughters are! "
231,HYMIE, He-- He only wants to see the spoons! 
232,MAMIE," Well-- Well, what do you have to bring him into my 
        house for? "
233,HYMIE," Mamie, he doesn't think about girls any more. "
234,MARTIN," Uh, Mrs. Meyer, as far as girls is concerned, I shot 
        my wad. "
235,MAMIE, You shot your wad? 
236,MARTIN, Definitely! 
237,MAMIE, Which spoons do you want to view? 
238,MARTIN," Oh, I guess the soup spoons. "
239,MAMIE, Now they're good spoons! 
240,MARTIN, You got 'em arranged? 
241,MAMIE," No, but I could arrange them for you. "
242,MARTIN," Oh, don't put yourself to no bother, Mrs. Meyer. "
243,MAMIE," It's no bother. I want for you to see these spoons like 
        I would want to see them myself. "
244,MARTIN," Aww, you're too kind, Mrs. Meyer. You could get your, 
        eh, daughters to show me them. "
245,MAMIE, Hymie! Get him out of here! 
246,HYMIE," Mamie! Mamie! He only said for Audrey and Myrtle to 
        show him the spoons. "
247,MAMIE," Like you think I'm running some kind of bordello here?!
        "
248,MARTIN," Mrs. Meyer, how can you say such a thing? "
249,MAMIE," Listen, Martin Luther! I know what you want to do with 
        my girls. "
250,MARTIN," Show me the spoons, ehh? "
251,MAMIE, You want for them to pull up their skirts... 
252,AUDREY and MYRTLE, 
253,MAMIE," ...and then lean over a chair with their legs apart.
        "
254,HYMIE," Mamie, don't get excited. "
255,MAMIE," I'm getting excited?! It's him that's getting excited!
        "
256,MARTIN, My mind is on the spoons! 
257,MAMIE," But you can't stop thinking of those little girls over 
        the chairs! "
258,HYMIE," Oh, oh, I got to go to the bathroom. "
259,MAMIE," Hymie, I'm a married woman! "
260,HYMIE, So! Just show him the spoons! 
261,MAMIE, And you don't want to put nothing up me? 
262,MARTIN," Mrs. Meyer, you read my mind. "
263,NARRATOR," Yes, another convert for the Protestants. But 
        despite Luther's efforts to promote the idea of sex for pleasure, 
        children multiplied everywhere. "

265,HUMPHREY WILLIAMS," ...And spotteth twice they the camels 
        before the third hour, and so, the Midianites went forth to Ram Gilead 
        in Kadesh Bilgemath, by Shor Ethra Regalion, to the house of 
        Gash-Bil-Bethuel-Bazda, he who brought the butter dish to Balshazar and 
        the tent peg to the house of Rashomon, and there slew they the goats, 
        yea, and placed they the bits in little pots. Here endeth the lesson.

268,CHAPLAIN," ...ooh, You are so big,... "
269,CONGREGATION," ...ooh, You are so big,... "
270,CHAPLAIN, ...so absolutely huge. 
271,CONGREGATION, ...so absolutely huge. 
272,CHAPLAIN," Gosh, we're all really impressed down here, I can 
        tell You. "
273,CONGREGATION," Gosh, we're all really impressed down here, I 
        can tell You. "
274,CHAPLAIN," Forgive us, O Lord, for this, our dreadful toadying, 
        and... "
275,CONGREGATION, And barefaced flattery. 
276,CHAPLAIN," But You are so strong and, well, just so super. "
277,CONGREGATION, Fantastic. 
278,HUMPHREY, Amen. 
279,CONGREGATION, Amen. 
280,HUMPHREY," Now, two boys have been found rubbing linseed oil 
        into the school cormorant. Now, some of you may feel that the cormorant 
        does not play an important part in the life of the school, but I would 
        remind you that it was presented to us by the Corporation of the town of 
        Sudbury to commemorate Empire Day, when we try to remember the names of 
        all those from the Sudbury area who so gallantly gave their lives to 
        keep China British. So, from now on, the cormorant is strictly out of 
        bounds! Oh, and Jenkins, apparently your mother died this morning.

283,PUPILS, 
284,HUMPHREY," All right, settle down. Settle down. "
285,WYMER, Sir? 
286,HUMPHREY," Yes, Wymer? "
287,WYMER," My younger brother's going out with Dibble this 
        weekend, sir, but I'm not having my hair cut today, sir. "
288,PUPILS, 
289,WYMER," So, do I move my clothes down, or-- "
290,HUMPHREY," I do wish you'd listen, Wymer. It's perfectly 
        simple. If you're not getting your hair cut, you don't have to move your 
        brother's clothes down to the lower peg. You simply collect his note 
        before lunch, after you've done your scripture prep, when you've written 
        your letter home, before rest, move your own clothes onto the lower peg, 
        greet the visitors, and report to Mr. Viney that you've had your chit 
        signed. Now, sex. Sex, sex, sex. Where were we? "
291,PUPILS, Umm. Mmmm. 
292,BIGGS," Nnnno, sir. "
293,WATSON," No, sir. "
294,BIGGS," No, sir. "
295,WATSON, No. 
296,PUPILS, No... 
297,WATSON, No. 
298,HUMPHREY," Well, had I done foreplay? "
299,PUPILS, Mmmm. Yeah. Yeah... 
300,WATSON, Yes. 
301,BIGGS," Yes, sir. "
302,WATSON," Yes, sir. "
303,HUMPHREY," Ahh, well, as we all know all about foreplay, no 
        doubt you can tell me what the purpose of foreplay is,... Biggs. "
304,BIGGS," Uhm-- Don't know. Sorry, sir. "
305,HUMPHREY, Carter. 
306,CARTER," Ah. Uhh, was it taking your clothes off, sir? "
307,HUMPHREY," Well, and-- and after that? "
308,WYMER," Ooh. Putting them on the lower peg, sir? "
309,PUPILS, 
310,HUMPHREY," The purpose of foreplay is to cause the vagina to 
        lubricate, so that the penis can penetrate more easily. "
311,WATSON," Could we have a window open, please, sir? "
312,HUMPHREY," Yes. Harris, will you? And, of course, to cause the 
        man's penis to erect and har... den! "
313,WATSON," Oh, sir. "
314,BIGGS," Oh, sir. "
315,PUPILS," Oh, sir... "
316,HUMPHREY," So, just listen. Now, did I or did I not... do... 
        vaginal... juices? "
317,PUPILS," Mmm. Mmm. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. "
318,HUMPHREY," Name two ways of getting them flowing, Watson. "
319,WATSON," R-- rubbing the clitoris, sir? "
320,HUMPHREY," What's wrong with a kiss, boy? Hmm? Why not start 
        her off with a nice kiss? You don't have to go leaping straight for the 
        clitoris like a bull at a gate. Give her a kiss, boy. "
321,WYMER," Suck the nipple, sir? "
322,HUMPHREY," Good! Good. Well done, Wymer. "
323,DUCKWORTH," Uh, stroking the thighs, sir. "
324,HUMPHREY," Yes. Yes, I suppose so. Hmm? "
325,PUPIL IN FRONT," Oh, sir. Biting the neck. "
326,HUMPHREY," Yes. Good. Nibbling the earlobe, uhh, kneading the 
        buttocks, and so on and so forth. So, we have all these possibilities 
        before we stampede towards the clitoris, Watson. "
327,WATSON," Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. "
328,HUMPHREY," Now, all these forms of stimulation can now take 
        place,... "
329,CARTER," Oh, sorry, sir. Sorry. "
330,HELEN WILLIAMS," Humphrey, I hope you don't mind, but I told 
        the Garfields we would dine with them tonight. "
331,HUMPHREY," Yes. Yes, well, I suppose we must. "
332,HELEN, And I said we'd be there by eight. 
333,HUMPHREY," Well, at least it'll give me a reason to wind up the 
        staff meeting. "
334,HELEN," Well, I know you don't like them, but I couldn't make 
        another excuse. "
335,HUMPHREY," Well, it's just that I felt n-- Wymer! This is for 
        your benefit. Would you kindly wake up? I've no intention of going 
        through this all again. "
336,WYMER, Ahhh. 
337,HUMPHREY," Uhh, we'll take the foreplay as read, if you don't 
        mind, dear. "
338,HELEN," No, of course not, Humphrey. "
339,HUMPHREY," So, the man starts by entering-- or mounting-- his 
        good lady wife in the standard way. Uh, the penis is now, as you will 
        observe, more or less, fully erect. There we are. Ah, that's better. 
        Now,-- Carter. "
340,CARTER," Yes, sir? "
341,HUMPHREY, What is it? 
342,CARTER," It's an ocarina, sir. "
343,HUMPHREY," Bring it up here. The man now starts making 
        thrusting movements with his pelvic area, moving the penis up and down 
        inside the vagina, so-- Put it there, boy. Put it there on the table.
        "
344,BIGGS, 
345,HUMPHREY," ...excitement mounts, uh,-- What's funny, Biggs? "
346,BIGGS," Uh,-- Oh, nothing, sir. "
347,HUMPHREY," Oh, do please share your little joke with the rest 
        of us. I mean, obviously something frightfully funny's going on. "
348,PUPIL, 
349,BIGGS," No. Honestly, sir. "
350,HUMPHREY," Well, as it's so funny, I think you'd better be 
        selected to play for the boys' team in the rugby match against the 
        masters this afternoon! "
351,BIGGS," Oh, no, sir. "
352,CROWD, 
353,BOY, Ohh! Aaaahh! 
354,HUMPHREY, Well done. Okay. 
355,BOYS, Ohh! Uuhh! 
356,CROWD, 
357,BOYS, Uuhh! Aw. Uy! Ahh... 
358,CROWD, 
359,ANNOUNCER," The Meaning of Life: Part Three: Fighting Each 
        Other. "
360,SOLDIERS, Hh. Uhh. Look out. 
361,BIGGS," Okay. Blackitt, Sturridge, and Walters, you take the 
        buggers on the left flank. Hordern, Spadger, and I... "
362,SPADGER," Right, sir. "
363,BLACKITT," Oh, hang on a tick, sir. "
364,SPADGER, Yeah. 
365,BLACKITT," You'll never make it, sir. Let us come with you. "
366,BIGGS," Do as you're told, man. "
367,BLACKITT," Right-o, skipper. "
368,BIGGS," Yes, well,... "
369,SPADGER, Yeah. 
370,BIGGS, ...I think this is... 
371,BLACKITT," No. No, me and the lads realize this, sir, but, 
        well,... "
372,BIGGS, Ehh. 
373,BLACKITT," ...we may never meet again, sir, so,... I-- "
374,BIGGS," Yes, all-- all-- all right, Blackitt. Thanks a lot. "
375,BLACKITT," No, eh, just a moment, sir. "
376,SPADGER, Duck. 
377,BLACKITT," You see,... "
378,SPADGER, Ahh. 
379,BLACKITT," We bought you this, sir. "
380,SPADGER, Ah. Hhh. 
381,BIGGS," Oh. Well, i-- I don't know what to say. "
382,SPADGER," All right, sir. "
383,BIGGS, ...but-- 
384,WALTERS, You're welcome. 
385,BIGGS," But I-- I-- I-- I think we'd better get to cover now.
        "
386,BLACKITT," Hang on a tick, sir. We got something else for you 
        as well, sir. "
387,SPADGER, Aah. 
388,BLACKITT, Uh. 
389,SOLDIERS, Ah. Ah. Ehh... 
390,BLACKITT," Sorry it's another clock, sir,... "
391,BIGGS," Well, it's-- it's beautiful. "
392,WALTERS, Aah! 
393,BIGGS," I-- I think we'd better get to cover now,... "
394,BLACKITT," Oh, sir, and Corp-- "
395,BIGGS, ...and I'll thank you properly later on. 
396,SPADGER, Uhh. Ehh. 
397,BLACKITT," Corporal Sturridge got this for you as well, sir. He 
        didn't know about the others, sir. It's Swiss. "
398,BIGGS," Oh, well, now, that is thoughtful, Sturridge. Good man.
        "
399,BLACKITT," And there's a card, sir,... from all of us. Sorry 
        about the blood, sir. "
400,BIGGS, Thank you all. 
401,BLACKITT," Squad,... "
402,SOLDIERS, Hooray! 
403,BLACKITT, Hip hip-- 
404,SOLDIERS, Hooray! 
405,BLACKITT, Hip hip-- 
406,SOLDIERS, Hooray! 
407,BIGGS, Blackitt! Blackitt! 
408,BLACKITT," I-- I'll be all right, sir. Oh, there's just... one 
        other thing, sir. Spadge, give him the cheque. "
409,SPADGER," Oh, yeah. Uhh. "
410,BIGGS," Oh, now, this is really going too far. "
411,SPADGER," Oh. I don't seem to be able to find it, sir. Uhh, 
        it'll be in-- be in Number Four Trench. I'll go and get it. "
412,BIGGS," For Christ's sake, forget it, man! "
413,SPADGER," You shouldn't have said that, sir. "
414,BLACKITT," Don't mind me, Spadge. Toffs is all the same. One 
        minute it's all 'please' and 'thank you', and the next, they'll kick you 
        in the teeth! "
415,STURRIDGE, Yeah. 
416,BLACKITT, 
417,WALTERS, Let's not give him the cake. 
418,BIGGS, I don't want any cake. 
419,SPADGER," Look. Blackitt cooked it specially for you, you 
        bastard! "
420,STURRIDGE," Yeah, he saved his rations for six weeks, sir. "
421,BIGGS, Sorry. I didn't mean to be ungrateful. 
422,SPADGER, Yeah. 
423,BLACKITT, I'll be all right. 
424,SPADGER," Blackitt! Blackie! Look at him. He worked on that 
        cake like no one else I've ever known. "
425,BIGGS," Oh, my Christ! "
426,STURRIDGE, You bastard. 
427,BIGGS, All right! 
428,WALTERS," Yes, sir. How many plates? "
429,BIGGS, Six. 
430,WALTERS, Fine. 
431,BIGGS, Uh. 
432,WALTERS, Agh. 
433,BIGGS, Oh. Better make it five. 
434,STURRIDGE," Tablecloth, sir? "
435,BIGGS," Yes, get the tablecloth. "
436,STURRIDGE, Aaghh! Uh. 
437,BIGGS," No, no, no, no. I'll-- "
438,HORDERN," Ohh. Aahh! And the little mats, sir? "
439,BIGGS, Yes! 
440,HORDERN, Right-o. 
441,BIGGS," All right, while you're at it, you'd better get a 
        doily! "
442,HORDERN," I'll bring two, sir, in case one gets scrumpled. "
443,BIGGS, Okay! Eh. 
444,GENERAL," Well, of course, warfare isn't all fun. Right. Stop 
        that! It's all very well to laugh at the Military, but, when one 
        considers the meaning of life, it is a struggle between alternative 
        viewpoints of life itself, and without the ability to defend one's own 
        viewpoint against other perhaps more aggressive ideologies, then 
        reasonableness and moderation could, quite simply, disappear. That is 
        why we'll always need an army, and may God strike me down were it to be 
        otherwise. "
445,SERGEANT MAJOR," Don't stand there gawping like you've never 
        seen the Hand of God before! Now, today, we're going to do marching up 
        and down the square! That is, unless any of you got anything better to 
        do. Well?! Anyone got anything they'd rather be doing than marching up 
        and down the square?! Yes?! Atkinson. What would you... rather be doing, 
        Atkinson? "
446,ATKINSON," Well, to be quite honest, Sarge, I'd... rather be at 
        home with the wife and kids. "
447,SERGEANT MAJOR," Would you, now?! "
448,ATKINSON," Yes, Sarge. "
449,SERGEANT MAJOR," Right! Off you go! Now, everybody else happy 
        with my little plan... of marching up and down the square a bit? "
450,COLES, Sarge! 
451,SERGEANT MAJOR, Yes?! 
452,COLES, I've got a book I'd quite like to read. 
453,SERGEANT MAJOR," Right! You go read your book, then! Now! 
        Everybody else... quite content to join in... with my little scheme of 
        marching up and down the square?! "
454,WYCLIF, Sarge? 
455,SERGEANT MAJOR," Yes, Wyclif?! What is it?! "
456,WYCLIF," Well, I'm, uh, learning the piano. "
457,SERGEANT MAJOR, Learning the piano?! 
458,WYCLIF," Yes, Sarge. "
459,SERGEANT MAJOR," And I suppose you want to go and practice, eh? 
        Marching up and down the square not good enough for you, eh?! "
460,WYCLIF," Well,-- "
461,SERGEANT MAJOR, Right! Off you go! 
462,WYCLIF, Oh. 
463,SERGEANT MAJOR," Now! What about the rest of you? Rather be at 
        the pictures, I suppose. "
464,SQUAD," Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ooh, yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right.
        "
465,SERGEANT MAJOR, All right! Off you go! 
466,SQUAD," Oh. Ooh. Great. That's great. What a day. I want to see 
        the Merle Oberon picture. Eh hehheh. "
467,SERGEANT MAJOR," Bloody army! I don't know what it's coming to. 
        Right! Sergeant Major, marching up and down the square. Left, right, 
        left. Left... "
468,NARRATOR #1," Democracy and humanitarianism have always been 
        trademarks of the British Army... "
469,SERGEANT MAJOR, Rubbish! 
470,NARRATOR #1," Shh! ...And have stamped its triumph throughout 
        history, in the furthest-flung corners of the Empire,... "
471,AINSWORTH, 'Scuse me. 
472,PAKENHAM-WALSH," Morning, Ainsworth. "
473,AINSWORTH," Morning, Pakenham. "
474,PAKENHAM-WALSH, Sleep well? 
475,AINSWORTH," Not bad. Bit to shreds, though. Must be a hole in 
        the bloody mosquito net. "
476,PAKENHAM-WALSH," Yes. Savage little blighters, aren't they? "
477,FIRST LIEUTENANT CHADWICK," Excuse me, sir. "
478,AINSWORTH," Yes, Chadwick? "
479,CHADWICK," I'm afraid Perkins got rather badly bitten during 
        the night. "
480,AINSWORTH," Well, so did we. Huh. "
481,CHADWICK," Yes, but I do think doctor ought to see him. "
482,AINSWORTH," Well, go and fetch him, then. "
483,CHADWICK," Right you are, sir. "
484,AINSWORTH," Suppose I'd better go along. Coming, Pakenham? "
485,PAKENHAM-WALSH," Yes, I suppose so. "
486,AINSWORTH, Careful! 
487,PAKENHAM-WALSH," Come on, boy. "
488,AINSWORTH," Ah! Morning, Perkins. "
489,PERKINS," Morning, sir. "
490,AINSWORTH," What's, uh,-- what's all the trouble, then? "
491,PERKINS," Bitten, sir. During the night. "
492,AINSWORTH," Hmm. Whole leg gone, eh? "
493,PERKINS, Yes. 
494,AINSWORTH, How does it feel? 
495,PERKINS, Stings a bit. 
496,AINSWORTH," Mmm. Well, it would, wouldn't it? That's, uh,... 
        quite a bite you've got there, you know. "
497,PERKINS," Yes, a... real beauty, isn't it? "
498,AINSWORTH, Any idea how it happened? 
499,PERKINS," None whatsoever. Complete mystery to me. Woke up just 
        now, one sock too many. "
500,PAKENHAM-WALSH," You must have a hell of a hole in your net.
        "
501,AINSWORTH," Hmm. Well, we've sent for the doctor. "
502,PERKINS," Ohh, hardly worth it, isn't it? "
503,AINSWORTH," Oh, yes. Better safe than sorry. "
504,PAKENHAM-WALSH," Yes. Good Lord, look at this. "
505,AINSWORTH," By jove, that's enormous! "
506,PAKENHAM-WALSH," You don't think it'll come back, do you? "
507,AINSWORTH," For more, you mean? "
508,PAKENHAM-WALSH, Yes. 
509,AINSWORTH, You're right. We'd better get this stitched. 
510,PAKENHAM-WALSH, Right. 
511,AINSWORTH," Ah, hello, doc. "
512,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE," Morning! I came as fast as I could. Is, 
        uhh,-- is something up? "
513,AINSWORTH," Yes. Uh, during the night, old Perkins got his leg 
        bitten sort of... off. Mm? "
514,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE," Ahh. Been in the wars, have we? "
515,PAKENHAM-WALSH, Mhm. 
516,PERKINS, Yes. 
517,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE," Ehh. Any headache? Bowels all right? Mm. 
        Well, let's have a look at this one leg of yours, then, eh? Yes. Yes. 
        Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, well, this is nothing to worry about.
        "
518,PERKINS," Oh, good. "
519,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE," Yes, there's a lot of it about. Probably a 
        virus. Uh, keep warm, plenty of rest, and if you're playing football or 
        anything, try and favor the other leg. "
520,PERKINS, Oh. 
521,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE, Mhm. 
522,PERKINS, Right-o. 
523,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE," Be as right as rain in a couple of days.
        "
524,PERKINS," Oh. Thanks for the reassurance, doc. "
525,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE," Not at all. That's what I'm here for. Any 
        other problems I can reassure you about? "
526,PERKINS," No, I'm fine. "
527,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE," Jolly good. Well, must be off. M-hmm. "
528,PERKINS," So, it'll, ehh,-- it'll just grow back again, then, 
        will it? "
529,DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE," Uhh,... I think I'd better come clean with 
        you about this. It's, um,-- it's not a virus, I'm afraid. You see, a 
        virus is what we doctors call very, very small. So small, it could not 
        possibly have made off with a whole leg. What we're looking for here is, 
        I think,-- And this is no more than an educated guess. I'd like to make 
        that clear. ...Is some multi-cellular life form with stripes, huge 
        razor-sharp teeth, about eleven foot long, and of the genus Felis 
        Horribilis: what we doctors, in fact, call a 'tiger'. "
530,"PERKINS, PAKENHAM-WALSH, and AINSWORTH", A tiger?! 
531,EVERYONE, A tiger?! 
532,PAKENHAM-WALSH, A tiger... in Africa? 
533,AINSWORTH, Hm? 
534,PAKENHAM-WALSH, A tiger in Africa?! 
535,AINSWORTH," W-- Ah, well, it, uh,-- it has probably escaped 
        from a zoo. Mhm. "
536,PAKENHAM-WALSH, Doesn't sound very likely to me. 
537,AINSWORTH, Stumm. Stumm. Stumm. 
538,SERGEANT, Sir! 
539,AINSWORTH, Stumm. 
540,SERGEANT," Sir! Sir! Sir! The attack's over, sir! The Zulus are 
        retreating! "
541,AINSWORTH," Oh, jolly good. Mhm. "
542,SERGEANT," Quite a lot of casualties, though, sir. "
543,AINSWORTH, M-hmm. 
544,SERGEANT, 'C' Division wiped out. 
545,AINSWORTH, Yes. 
546,SERGEANT, Signals gone. 
547,AINSWORTH, Yes. 
548,SERGEANT, Thirty men killed in 'F' Section. 
549,AINSWORTH, Yes. I see. Mm. 
550,SERGEANT," I should think about a hundred-- hundred and fifty 
        men altogether, sir. "
551,AINSWORTH, Jolly good. 
552,SERGEANT," I haven't got the final figures, sir, but there's a 
        lot of seriously... "
553,AINSWORTH, Yes. 
554,SERGEANT, ...wounded in the compound. 
555,AINSWORTH," Yes. Well, the thing is, Sergeant, I've got a bit 
        of a problem here. One of the officers has lost a leg. "
556,SERGEANT," Oh, no, sir! "
557,AINSWORTH, I'm afraid so. Probably a tiger. 
558,SERGEANT, In Africa? 
559,AINSWORTH, Stumm. 
560,PAKENHAM-WALSH, 
561,AINSWORTH," Stumm. Stumm. Stumm. The M.O. says we can stitch it 
        back on if we can find it immediately. "
562,SERGEANT," Right, sir! I'll organise a party... right away, 
        sir. "
563,AINSWORTH," Well, it's hardly the time for that, is it 
        Sergeant? "
564,SERGEANT, Look. A-- a search party. 
565,AINSWORTH, Oh! Oh! Ah! Ahh! Much better idea! Mhmm. 
566,VICTIMS, 
567,SERGEANT," Oh, sorry about the mess, sir. We'll try and get it 
        cleared up by the time you get back. "
568,VICTIM #1," We showed 'em, didn't we, sir? "
569,AINSWORTH, Yes. 
570,SERGEANT," Here, we've got a search party. Leave that alone.
        "
571,VICTIM #2," This is fun, sir, isn't it? All this killing, 
        bloodshed-- Bloody good fun, sir, isn't it? "
572,RANDOM, 
573,AINSWORTH, Yes. Very good. 
574,POTTER'S HEAD," Morning, sir! "
575,RANDOM, Agh. 
576,AINSWORTH," Nasty wound you've got there, Potter. "
577,POTTER'S HEAD," Thank you very much, sir! "
578,RANDOM, Aghh. 
579,RANDOM, Aahh. 
580,AINSWORTH," Come on, Private. We're making up a search party.
        "
581,VICTIM #3," Better than staying at home, isn't this, sir? Eh? I 
        mean, at home, if you kill someone, they arrest you. Here, they give you 
        a gun and show you what to do, sir. "
582,RANDOM, Ooh. 
583,VICTIM #3," I mean, I killed fifteen of those buggers, sir. 
        Now, at home, they'd hang me! Here, they'll give me a fucking medal, 
        sir! "
584,AINSWORTH," Hah, mhm mhm mhm. "
585,SERGEANT," Sorry, sir. "
586,PAKENHAM-WALSH," Thank you, Sergeant Major. "
587,CHADWICK, Mm hm. 
588,AINSWORTH," Look! My God, it's huge! "
589,REAR END," Uhh. Uh, don't shoot. Don't shoot. We're not a 
        tiger. W-- Uhh, we were jus-- s-- st, um,-- "
590,AINSWORTH, Why are you dressed as a tiger? 
591,REAR END," Hm? Oh, 'why'! 'Why'! 'Why'! Haahh, isn't it a 
        lovely day today? "
592,AINSWORTH, Answer the question. 
593,REAR END," Oh, we were just, um,-- "
594,FRONT END," Well, uhh, actually, we're-- we're dressed like 
        this because, uh,-- Oh. No, that's not it. "
595,REAR END," Uh, we did it for a lark. Part of a spree. High 
        spirits, you know. Simple as that. Hm. "
596,FRONT END, Nothing more to it. Hah. 
597,REAR END, Ha ha. 
598,FRONT END," Well, actually, we're on a mission for British 
        Intelligence. Th-- th-- there's a pro-Tsarist Ashanti Chief, uh,-- "
599,REAR END," No, no. No. No, no. "
600,FRONT END," Uh, no. No, no, no. No. No. No. "
601,REAR END," No. No, no, no, no. No. No, we're doing it for an 
        advertisement. "
602,FRONT END," Ah, that's it. "
603,REAR END, Mhm. 
604,FRONT END," Uhh, forget about the Russians. "
605,REAR END, Mhm. 
606,FRONT END," Uh, we're-- we're doing an advert for 'Tiger' brand 
        coffee. "
607,REAR END," 'Tiger' brand coffee is a real treat. Even tigers 
        prefer a cup of it to real meat. Mm. "
608,AINSWORTH, Now look. 
609,REAR END," All right. All right. We are dressed as a tiger 
        because he had an auntie who did it in eighteen-thirty-nine, and this is 
        the fiftieth anniversary. "
610,FRONT END, No. We're doing it for a bet. 
611,REAR END, God told us to do it. 
612,FRONT END," To tell the truth, we are completely mad. "
613,REAR END, 
614,FRONT END," We are-- we are inmates of a Bengali psychiatric 
        institution and we escaped by making this skin out of old, used cereal 
        packets. "
615,REAR END, Mhm. 
616,PERKINS, It doesn't matter! 
617,AINSWORTH, What? 
618,PERKINS," It doesn't matter why they're dressed as a tiger. 
        Have they got my leg? "
619,AINSWORTH," Good thinking! Well, have you? "
620,REAR END," Actually,... "
621,AINSWORTH, Yes? 
622,REAR END," ...it's because we were thinking of training as 
        taxidermists and we want to get the feel of it from the animal's point 
        of view. "
623,AINSWORTH," Be quiet. Now look. We're just asking you if you've 
        got this man's leg. "
624,FRONT END, A wooden leg? 
625,AINSWORTH," No, no. A proper leg! Look. He was fast asleep, and 
        someone or something came in and removed it. "
626,FRONT END, Without waking him up? 
627,AINSWORTH, Yes. 
628,FRONT END, I don't believe you. 
629,REAR END," We found the tiger skin in a bicycle shop in Cairo. 
        The owner wanted it taken down to Dar Es Salaam-- "
630,AINSWORTH," Shut up! Now look. Have you or have you not got his 
        leg? "
631,REAR END, Yes. 
632,FRONT END, No. 
633,REAR END, No. 
634,FRONT END," No, no, no. "
635,REAR END," No. No, no, no. "
636,FRONT END," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. "
637,REAR END," No, no, no. No. No. No. No. "
638,AINSWORTH, Why did you say 'yes'? 
639,FRONT END, I didn't. 
640,AINSWORTH, I'm not talking to you. 
641,REAR END, Uum. Uum. Hmmhh. 
642,AINSWORTH, Right! Search the thicket. 
643,FRONT END," Oh, come on. I mean, do we look like the sort of 
        chaps who'd creep into a camp at night, steal into someone's tent, 
        anaesthetise them, tissue-type them, amputate a leg, and run away with 
        it? "
644,AINSWORTH, Search the thicket. 
645,FRONT END," Oh, 'leg'! You're looking for a leg! Actually, I 
        think there is one in there somewhere. Uhh, somebody must have abandoned 
        it here, knowing you were coming after it, and we stumbled across it, 
        actually, and wondered what it was, and they'll be miles away by now,...
        "
646,REAR END, Hmhm. As usual. 
647,ZULU ANNOUNCER," Hello. Good evening, and welcome to 'The 
        Middle of the Film'. "
648,LADY PRESENTER," Hello, and welcome to 'The Middle of the 
        Film', the moment where we take a break to invite you, the audience, to 
        join us, the film-makers, in 'Find the Fish'. We're going to show you a 
        scene from another film and ask you to guess where the fish is, but, if 
        you think you know, don't keep it to yourselves! Yell out so that all 
        the cinema can hear you. So, here we are with... 'Find the Fish'. 
        "
649,STRANGE MAN, I wonder where that fish has gone. 
650,STRANGE WOMAN," You did love it so. You looked after it like a 
        son. "
651,STRANGE MAN, And it went wherever I did go. 
652,STRANGE WOMAN, Is it in the cupboard? 
653,AUDIENCE, Yes! Yes! No!... 
654,STRANGE WOMAN," Wouldn't you like to know? It was a lovely 
        little fish. "
655,STRANGE MAN, And it went wherever I did go. 
656,MAN IN AUDIENCE, It's behind the sofa! 
657,STRANGE WOMAN, Where can that fish be? 
658,MAN IN AUDIENCE," Have you thought of the drawers in the 
        bureau?! "
659,RANDOM, Shh! 
660,STRANGE WOMAN, It is a most elusive fish! 
661,STRANGE MAN, And it went wherever I did go. 
662,STRANGE WOMAN," Ooooh, fishy, fishy, fishy fish! "
663,STRANGE MAN," A-fish, a-fish, a-fish, a-fishy, ooooh. "
664,STRANGE WOMAN," Ooooh, fishy, fishy, fishy fish! "
665,STRANGE MAN, That went wherever I did go. 
666,MAN IN AUDIENCE, Look up his trunk! 
667,MAN IN AUDIENCE," Yeah, it's hidden in his trousers! "
668,FISH #1, That was terrific! 
669,FISH #2, Great! 
670,FISH #4, Wonderful. 
671,FISH #2, Yeah! 
672,FISH #5, Yeah. 
673,FISH #3, Best bit so far. 
674,FISHES, 
675,FISH #2, Fantastic! 
676,FISH #1, Yeah. 
677,FISH #2, Yes! Really great! 
678,FISH #6, Very piscine. 
679,FISH #5, Ha ha hah. 
680,FISH #6," Yeah. Hee, hee, hee, hee. "
681,FISH #4, Oh! 
682,FISH #6, Ahh. 
683,FISH #1, Heh. 
684,FISH #2," They haven't said much about the meaning of life so 
        far, have they? "
685,FISH #1," Well, it's been building up to it. "
686,FISH #4, Has it? 
687,FISH #2, Has it? 
688,FISH #3," Yeah, I expect they'll get on to it now. "
689,FISH #5," Personally, I very much doubt if they're going to say 
        anything about the meaning of life at all. "
690,FISH #6," Oh, come on. They've got to say something. "
691,FISH #3, They're bound to. 
692,FISH #2, Yeah. 
693,FISH #4, Yeah. 
694,FISH #1, Yeah. 
695,FISH #3," What do you think the next bit will be, then? "
696,FISH #1," Caption, I expect. "
697,FISH #6," What? About the next stage of life, you mean? Oh, 
        yeah. Here we go. "
698,ANNOUNCER, Middle Age. 
699,FISH #6, Oh. Could've guessed it. 
700,MR. MARVIN HENDY," Oh, that's much better. Thank you, honey.
        "
701,MRS. HENDY, You're welcome. 
702,MR. HENDY, Mmmm. It was all sort of misty before. 
703,MRS. HENDY, M-hmm. 
704,MR. HENDY, That's fine. 
705,M'LADY JOELINE, Hi! How are you? 
706,MR. HENDY," Oh, we're just fine! "
707,JOELINE," What kind of food 'd you like to eat this evening?
        "
708,MR. HENDY," Well, we sort of like pineapples. "
709,JOELINE, Pineapple. Mmm. 
710,MRS. HENDY," Yeah, we love pineapple. "
711,JOELINE, Mmm. 
712,MR. HENDY," Yeah, anything with pineapple in it is great for 
        us. "
713,JOELINE," Mm. Well, how about the Dungeon Room? "
714,MRS. HENDY," Oh, look. "
715,MR. HENDY," Ohh, that sounds fine! "
716,JOELINE," Sure is. It's real Hawaiian food served in an 
        authentic, medieval English dungeon atmosphere. "
717,MR. HENDY, Ohh? 
718,MRS. HENDY, It's-- 
719,PRISONER, Aaaaaaaaaaah! 
720,MR. HENDY," Hmm m mm mm mmmm mm mm mmmm. Isn't this nice? Ha 
        hah. Why not? Good shot. Real Kodak. Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. 
        Hm mm mmmm. Dah dah... "
721,PRISONER, Aaaaaaaaaaah! 
722,MR. HENDY, ...dah dah dah dah daah. Daah. 
723,MRS. HENDY, Hm. 
724,MR. HENDY, Huhh huh mm. Mmm. 
725,MRS. HENDY, Hmm hmm. 
726,MR. HENDY, H-mmm. 
727,MRS. HENDY, Hmm. 
728,MR. HENDY, Mmm. 
729,WAITER," Good evening! Uhh, would you care for something to... 
        talk about? "
730,MR. HENDY," Oh, that would be wonderful. "
731,WAITER, Our special tonight is minorities! 
732,MR. HENDY," Ohh, that sounds real interesting. "
733,MRS. HENDY," Um, what's this conversation here? "
734,WAITER," Uh, that's, uh, 'football'. There you can talk about 
        the Steelers-Bears game this Saturday, or you could, uh, reminisce about 
        really great World Series. "
735,MRS. HENDY," No, no, no, no. "
736,MR. HENDY, What is this one here? 
737,WAITER," Uhh, that's 'philosophy'. "
738,MRS. HENDY, Is that a sport? 
739,WAITER," Aah, no, it's more of an attempt to, uh, construct a 
        viable hypothesis to, uh, explain the meaning of life. "
740,FISH #3, What was that? 
741,FISH #5, What's he say? 
742,FISH #4, What was that?! 
743,FISH #2, Shush. 
744,FISH #5, Eh? 
745,MR. HENDY," Oh, that sounds wonderful. Would you like to talk 
        about the meaning of life, darling? "
746,MRS. HENDY, Sure. Why not? 
747,WAITER, Philosophy for two? 
748,MR. HENDY, Right. 
749,WAITER, Room? 
750,MR. HENDY, Two-five-nine. 
751,WAITER, Two-five-nine. 
752,MR. HENDY," Yup. Uhh,-- uh, h-- how do we-- "
753,WAITER," Oh, uhh, you folks want me to start you off? "
754,MR. HENDY," Oh, really, we'd appreciate that. "
755,WAITER, Okay! 
756,MR. HENDY, Yeah. 
757,WAITER," Well, ehh,... "
758,MR. HENDY, Mhmm. 
759,WAITER," ...look. Have you ever wondered... just why you're 
        here? "
760,MR. HENDY," Well, we went to Miami last year and California the 
        year before that, and we've-- "
761,WAITER," No, no, no. I mean, uh, w-- why we're here... on this 
        planet. "
762,MR. HENDY, Hmmm. No. 
763,WAITER," Right! Aaah, you ever wanted to know what it's all 
        about? "
764,MR. HENDY, Nope. 
765,MRS. HENDY, No. No. 
766,WAITER," Right-o! Aah, well, uh, see, throughout history,...
        "
767,MR. HENDY, M-hmm. 
768,WAITER," ...there have been certain men and women who have 
        tried to find the solution to the mysteries of existence,... "
769,MRS. HENDY, G-reat. 
770,WAITER, ...and we call these guys 'philosophers'! 
771,MR. HENDY, Ohh. 
772,MRS. HENDY, And that's what we're talking about. 
773,WAITER, Right! 
774,MR. HENDY, Yeah. 
775,MRS. HENDY," Ohh, that's neat! "
776,WAITER," Well, you look like you're getting the idea, so why 
        don't I give you these, uh, conversation cards? They'll tell you a 
        little about philosophical method,... "
777,MR. HENDY, Oh. 
778,WAITER," ...names of famous philosophers,-- Uh, there you are. 
        Uhh, have a nice conversation! "
779,MR. HENDY," Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. "
780,MRS. HENDY, He's cute. 
781,MR. HENDY," Yeah, real-- "
782,MRS. HENDY, Yeah. 
783,MR. HENDY, Real understanding. Mmm. 
784,MRS. HENDY," Oh! I never knew Schopenhauer was a philosopher!
        "
785,MR. HENDY," Oh, yeah! He's the one that begins with an 'S'. "
786,MRS. HENDY, Oh. 
787,MR. HENDY," Umm, like, uh, 'Nietzsche'. "
788,MRS. HENDY, Does 'Nietzsche' begin with an 'S'? 
789,MR. HENDY," Uh, there's an 's' in 'Nietzsche'. "
790,MRS. HENDY," Oh, wow. Yes, there is. Do all philosophers have 
        an 's' in them? "
791,MR. HENDY," Uh, yeah! I think most of 'em do. "
792,MRS. HENDY," Oh. Does that mean Selina Jones is a philosopher?
        "
793,MR. HENDY," Yeah! Right! She could be! She sings about the 
        meaning of life. "
794,MRS. HENDY," Yeah. That's right, but I don't think she writes 
        her own material. "
795,MR. HENDY," No. Oh, maybe Schopenhauer writes her material. "
796,MRS. HENDY, No. Burt Bacharach writes it. 
797,MR. HENDY, But there's no 's' in 'Burt Bacharach'. 
798,MRS. HENDY, Or in 'Hal David'. 
799,MR. HENDY, Who's Hal David? 
800,MRS. HENDY," He writes the lyrics. Burt just writes the tunes, 
        only now, he's married to Carole Bayer Sager. "
801,MR. HENDY," Oh, waiter. This conversation isn't very good. "
802,WAITER," Oh, I'm sorry, sir! Uhh, we do have one today that's 
        not on the menu. It's sort of a specialty of the house, you know. "
803,MR. HENDY," Oh, yes. "
804,WAITER, 'Live Organ Transplants'. 
805,MRS. HENDY, 'Live Organ Transplants'? What's that?

        Transplants. "
807,MR. BROWN, 
808,MR. BROWN, Yes? 
809,MAN," Hello. Uhh, can we have your liver? "
810,MR. BROWN, My what? 
811,MAN," Your liver. It's a large, ehh, glandular organ in your 
        abdomen. "
812,ERIC, 
813,MAN," You know, it's, uh,-- it's reddish-brown. It's sort of, 
        uhh,-- "
814,MR. BROWN," Yeah,-- y-- y-- yeah, I know what it is, but... I'm 
        using it, eh. "
815,ERIC," Come on, sir. "
816,MR. BROWN, Hey! Hey! Stop! 
817,ERIC, Don't muck us about. 
818,MR. BROWN, Stop! Hey! Hey! Stop it. Hey! 
819,MAN, Hallo. 
820,MR. BROWN, Ge-- get off. 
821,MAN," What's this, then? Mmh. "
822,MR. BROWN, A liver donor's card. 
823,MAN, Need we say more? 
824,ERIC, No! 
825,MR. BROWN," Listen! I can't give it to you now. It says, 'in 
        the event of death'. Uh. Oh! Ah. Ah. Eh. "
826,MAN," No one who has ever had their liver taken out by us has 
        survived. "
827,MR. BROWN, Agh. 
828,ERIC," Just lie there, sir. It won't take a minute. "
829,MR. BROWN, 
830,MAN, Zip it up. 
831,MR. BROWN, 
832,MRS. BROWN, 'Ere. What's going on? 
833,MAN," Uh, he's donating his liver, madam. "
834,MR. BROWN, 
835,MRS. BROWN," Is this because he took out one of those silly 
        cards? "
836,MAN," That's right, madam. "
837,MR. BROWN, 
838,MRS. BROWN, Typical of him! 
839,MR. BROWN, 
840,MRS. BROWN," He goes down to the public library, he sees a few 
        signs up, comes home all full of good intentions. "
841,MR. BROWN, 
842,MRS. BROWN," He gives blood. He does cold research. All that 
        sort of thing. "
843,MAN, Oh. 
844,MR. BROWN, 
845,ERIC, Ehh. 
846,MRS. BROWN," What do you, uh,-- what do you do with them all, 
        anyway? "
847,ERIC," They all go to saving lives, madam. "
848,MRS. BROWN," Mmm. That's what he used to say. 'It's all for the 
        good of the country' he used to say. "
849,MR. BROWN, 
850,MRS. BROWN," Do you think it's all for the good of the country?
        "
851,MR. BROWN, 
852,MAN, Hm? 
853,MRS. BROWN," Do you think it's all for the good of the country?
        "
854,MAN," Well, I wouldn't know about that, madam. We're just, uh, 
        doing our jobs, you know. "
855,MR. BROWN, 
856,MRS. BROWN," You're not... doctors, then? "
857,MR. BROWN, 
858,MAN, Oh. Blimey no.

878,MR. BROWN, 
879,MAN, Thank you. 
880,MR. BROWN, 
881,MAN," Oh, eh,-- I thought she'd never ask. "
882,ERIC, You know it. 
883,MR. BROWN, 
884,MAN," Uhh, you do realize, uh, he has to be, uh,... well, 
        dead,... by the terms of the card, uh, before he donates his liver. "
885,MRS. BROWN," Well, I told him that, but he never listens to me. 
        Silly man! "
886,MR. BROWN, 
887,MAN," Only I was wondering, ehh,... well, you know, what you 
        was thinking of doing after that. I mean, "
888,MRS. BROWN," I'm too old for that sort of thing. I'm past my 
        prime. "
889,MAN, Not at all. You're a very attractive woman. 
890,MRS. BROWN," Well, I'm certainly not thinking of getting 
        hitched up again. "
891,MAN, Sure? 
892,MRS. BROWN, Sure. 
893,MAN," Can we have your liver, then? "
894,MRS. BROWN," Oh. No, I'd be... scared. "
895,MAN, All right. 
896,MAN IN PINK, 
897,MRS. BROWN, 
898,MAN, Yeah. Yeah. 
899,MRS. BROWN, Yeah. All right. You talked me into it.

901,CHAIRMAN," ...Which brings us once again to the urgent 
        realization of just how much there is still left to own. Item six on the 
        agenda: the meaning of life. Now, uh, Harry, you've had some thoughts on 
        this. "
902,HARRY," That's right. Yeah, I've had a team working on this 
        over the past few weeks, and, uh, what we've come up with can be reduced 
        to two fundamental concepts. One: people are not wearing enough hats. 
        Two: matter is energy. In the universe, there are many energy fields 
        which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source 
        which act upon a person's soul. However, this soul does not exist ab 
        initio, as orthodox Christianity teaches. It has to be brought into 
        existence by a process of guided self-observation. However, this is 
        rarely achieved, owing to man's unique ability to be distracted from 
        spiritual matters by everyday trivia. "
903,BERT," What was that about hats, again? "
904,HARRY," Oh, uh, people aren't wearing enough. "
905,CHAIRMAN, Is this true? 
906,EDMUND," Certainly. Hat sales have increased, but not pari 
        passu, as our research initially-- "
907,BERT," But when you say 'enough', enough for what purpose? "
908,GUNTHER," Can I just ask, with reference to your second point, 
        when you say souls don't develop because people become distracted,...

974,MAÎTRE D," Oh, sir. Hmm? "
975,MR. CREOSOTE,

986,MAÎTRE D," M-hm-hmm. You know, Maria, I sometimes wonder if 
        we'll ever discover the meaning of it all working in a place like this.
        "
987,MARIA," Oh, I've worked in worse places, philosophically 
        speaking. "
988,MAÎTRE D," Really, Maria? "
989,MARIA," Yes. I used to work in the Académie Française, but it 
        didn't do me any good at all, "
990,MAÎTRE D, 
991,GASTON," As for me, huh, if you want to know what I think, "
992,MAÎTRE D," Ah! I was saying that-- Uh, allo? "

1028,GEOFFREY," Yes, well, the thing is, we've got some people from 
        America for dinner tonight, and-- "
1029,ANGELA," Who is it, darling? "
1030,GEOFFREY," It's a 'Mr. Death' or something. He's come about the 
        reaping? I don't think we need any at the moment. "
1031,ANGELA," Hello. Well, don't leave him hanging around outside, 
        darling. Ask him in. "
1032,GEOFFREY," Darling, I don't think it's quite the moment. "
1033,ANGELA," Do come in. Come along in. Come and have a drink. Do. 
        Come on. "
1034,GUESTS, 
1035,ANGELA, It's one of the little men from the village. 
1036,GUESTS, 
1037,ANGELA," Uh, do come in. "
1038,GUESTS, 
1039,ANGELA, Please. 
1040,GUESTS, 
1041,ANGELA, This is Howard Katzenberg from Philadelphia... 
1042,HOWARD KATZENBERG, Hi. 
1043,ANGELA," ...and his wife, Debbie,... "
1044,DEBBIE, Hello there. 
1045,ANGELA," ...and these are the Portland-Smythes, Jeremy and 
        Fiona. "
1046,FIONA PORTLAND-SMYTHE, Good evening. 
1047,ANGELA, This is Mr. Death. 
1048,GEOFFREY," Uh, yes. "
1049,HOWARD, Mmm. 
1050,ANGELA, Mr. Death is a reaper. 
1051,GRIM REAPER, The Grim Reaper. 
1052,ANGELA," Hardly surprising, in this weather. Ha ha ha. "
1053,EVERYONE, 
1054,HOWARD," So, you still, uh, reap around here, do you, Mr. 
        Death? "
1055,GRIM REAPER, I am the Grim Reaper. 
1056,GEOFFREY, That's about all he says. 
1057,DEBBIE, Heh. 
1058,GEOFFREY," There's your drink, Mr. Death. "
1059,ANGELA, Do sit down. 
1060,DEBBIE," We were just talking about some of the awful problems 
        facing the thir-- "
1061,ANGELA," Ohh. Would you prefer white? I-- I'm afraid we don't 
        have any beer. "
1062,JEREMY PORTLAND-SMYTHE, The Stilton's awfully good. 
1063,GRIM REAPER, I am not of this world. 
1064,GEOFFREY, Good Lord. 
1065,GRIM REAPER, I am death. 
1066,DEBBIE," Well, isn't that extraordinary? We were just talking 
        about death only five minutes ago. "
1067,ANGELA," Yes, we were. "
1068,HOWARD, Mmm. Mm. 
1069,ANGELA," You know, whether death is really the end. "
1070,DEBBIE," As my husband, uh, Howard, here, feels, or whether 
        there is-- and one so hates to use words like 'soul' or 'spirit', but--
        "
1071,JEREMY, But what other words can one use? 
1072,GEOFFREY, E-- exactly. 
1073,GRIM REAPER, You do not understand. 
1074,DEBBIE," Ah, no. Obviously not. "
1075,HOWARD," Let me just tell you something, Mr. Death. "
1076,GRIM REAPER, You do n-- 
1077,HOWARD," Just one moment. I'd like to express, on behalf of 
        everybody here, what a... really unique experience this is. "
1078,JEREMY," Hear, hear. "
1079,ANGELA," Yes, we're so delighted, uh, that you dropped in, Mr. 
        Death. "
1080,HOWARD," Can I just finish, please? "
1081,DEBBIE," Mr. Death, is there an after-life? "
1082,HOWARD," Dear, if you could just wait, please, a moment,-- "
1083,ANGELA, Are you sure you wouldn't like some sherry? 
1084,DEBBIE, 
1085,HOWARD," Angela. Angela, I'd like to just say this at this 
        time, if I could, please. Really. "
1086,GRIM REAPER, Be quiet! 
1087,HOWARD," Can I just say this at this time, please? "
1088,GRIM REAPER, Silence! I have come for you. 
1089,ANGELA, You mean... to-- 
1090,GRIM REAPER," Take you away. That is my purpose. I am death.
        "
1091,GEOFFREY," Well, that's cast rather a gloom over the evening, 
        hasn't it? "
1092,HOWARD," I don't see it that way, Geoff. "
1093,GRIM REAPER," Shut up! Shut up, you American. You always talk, 
        you Americans. You talk and you talk and say 'let me tell you something' 
        and 'I just wanna say this'. Well, you're dead now, so shut up! "
1094,HOWARD, Dead? 
1095,GRIM REAPER, Dead. 
1096,ANGELA, All of us? 
1097,GRIM REAPER, All of you. 
1098,GEOFFREY," Now, look here. You barge in here, quite uninvited, 
        break glasses, and then announce, quite casually, that we're all dead. 
        Well, I would remind you that you are a guest in this house, and-- "
1099,GRIM REAPER," Be quiet! Englishmen, you're all so fucking 
        pompous, and none of you have got any balls. "
1100,DEBBIE, Can I ask you a question? 
1101,GRIM REAPER, What? 
1102,DEBBIE, How can we all have died at the same time? 
1103,GRIM REAPER, The salmon mousse. 
1104,GEOFFREY," Darling, you didn't use canned salmon, did you? "
1105,ANGELA, I'm most dreadfully embarrassed. 
1106,GRIM REAPER, Now the time has come. Follow. Follow me. 
1107,GEOFFREY, Just... testing. Sorry. 
1108,GRIM REAPER, Follow me. Now. 
1109,ANGELA," Well, the fishmonger promised me he'd have some fresh 
        salmon, and he's normally so reliable. "
1110,RANDOM, Stumm. Stumm. 
1111,JEREMY, Can we keep our glasses? 
1112,RANDOM, Mmm hmm. 
1113,FIONA, Oh. Good idea. 
1114,RANDOM, Come on. 
1115,GUESTS, 
1116,HOWARD, Okay. 
1117,GUESTS, 
1118,DEBBIE," Hey, I didn't even eat the mousse. "
1119,GUESTS, 
1120,ANGELA," Honestly, darling, I'm so embarrassed. It really is 
        embarrassing. I mean,... "
1121,HOWARD, I suppose... 
1122,ANGELA," ...to serve salmon with botulism at a dinner party is 
        social death for me. "
1123,GEOFFREY," Well, all right. "
1124,GUESTS, 
1125,JEREMY," Uh, shall we take our cars? "
1126,FIONA, Do we need them? 
1127,GEOFFREY, Why not? 
1128,ANGELA, Yes. Why not? 
1129,HOWARD, 
1130,ANGELA, Good idea. 
1131,RANDOM, Yes. Why not? 
1132,GUESTS, 
1133,RANDOM, Shall we go separately? 
1134,GUESTS, 
1135,GRIM REAPER, Behold... Paradise. 
1136,MR. HENDY," I love it here, darling. "
1137,MRS. HENDY," Me too, Marvin. "
1138,RECEPTIONIST," Hello. Welcome to Heaven. Excuse me, could you 
        just sign here, please, sir? "
1139,JEREMY, Yes. 
1140,RECEPTIONIST," Thank you! There's a table for you through there 
        in the restaurant. "
1141,JEREMY, Thank you. 
1142,RECEPTIONIST," For the ladies,... "
1143,FIONA, Mhm. 'After-life Mints'. 
1144,DEBBIE, Thank you. 
1145,RECEPTIONIST, Happy Christmas! 
1146,DEBBIE," Oh, is it Christmas today? "
1147,RECEPTIONIST," Of course, madam. It's Christmas every day in 
        Heaven. "
1148,DEBBIE, Ohh. 
1149,HOWARD, Mmm. 
1150,DEBBIE, How about that? 
1151,HOWARD, Hello there. 
1152,DEBBIE, Ah. 
1153,CROWD, 
1154,TONY BENNETT," Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's truly a 
        real honorable experience to be here this evening, a very wonderful and 
        warm and emotional moment for all of us, and I'd like to sing a song for 
        all... of you. "
1155,JOSEPH AND MARY, 
1156,THREE WISE MEN, 
1157,EVERYONE, 
1158,LADY PRESENTER," Well, that's the end of the film. Now, here's 
        the meaning of life. Thank you, Brigitte. M-hmm. Well, it's nothing very 
        special. Uh, try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good 
        book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together 
        in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations, and, 
        finally, here are some completely gratuitous pictures of penises to 
        annoy the censors and to hopefully spark some sort of controversy, 
        which, it seems, is the only way, these days, to get the jaded, 
        video-sated public off their fucking arses and back in the sodding 
        cinema. Family entertainment bollocks. What they want is filth: people 
        doing things to each other with chainsaws during tupperware parties, 
        babysitters being stabbed with knitting needles by gay presidential 
        candidates, vigilante groups strangling chickens, armed bands of theatre 
        critics exterminating mutant goats-- Where's the fun in pictures? Oh, 
        well, there we are. Here's the theme music. Goodnight. "
